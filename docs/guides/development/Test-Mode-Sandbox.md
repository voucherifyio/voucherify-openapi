Each Voucherify account has a Sandbox project which isn't included in your project limit. You can use it to run your use cases and try out Voucherify capabilities. 

Sandbox projects have their unique API keys for authorization.

## How to use the Sandbox project

Sandbox is the default project when you create a new Voucherify account. 

When you create a subscription, Sandbox will be visible in your projects list and it won't be counted to your limit.

In **Project settings > Application keys**, you can see API keys necessary to [authorize](doc:authentication) API requests. 

> ðŸ“˜ API calls limit
> 
> Sandbox has a fixed API calls limit set to 100 calls per hour. Sandbox API requests are not counted into your account limits of API calls.

## Demo shop

Sandbox is connected to a showcase demo shop. The demo shop presents how the integration between Voucherify and customer touchpoints might look in practice. 

With this setup, you can create campaigns and immediately see how they work at the checkout. For example, you can validate and redeem codes from created campaigns to test different promo scenarios and validation rules. Each redemption will be tracked in the dashboard.

To access the demo shop, go to your Sandbox project and click the Demo Shop button in the top bar.

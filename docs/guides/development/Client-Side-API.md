Sometimes it's important to validate a promo code or promotion on the client-side, e.g., you want to calculate and display a discounted price on the fly. That's why Voucherify comes with client-side features build in [Voucherify JS SDK](https://github.com/voucherifyio/voucherify-js-sdk) - an open-source JavaScript library which enables you to query the API. 

Among other features it delivers [Voucherify React Widgets](https://github.com/voucherifyio/voucherify-js-sdk#-voucherify-react-widget)

Voucherify JS SDK offers many client-side features:
- `validate widget` which enables your customers to validate their codes and check its validity in a given context.
- `redeem widget` which enables your customers to redeem the promo codes.
- `publish widget` which enables your customers to a unique voucher from a given campaign in exchange for providing an email address.
- `subscribe widget` which adds a [customer](ref:get-customer) to Voucherify. You can then use one of the [automatic delivery](doc:automatic-delivery) channels to send him/her a coupon.

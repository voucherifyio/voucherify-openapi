## Fraud Prevention Mechanisms

In Voucherify, your digital safety matters. While our promotion engine has built-in fraud prevention mechanisms, you can add your own protective layers or tap into external services. This guide provides straightforward steps to boost your security, making your Voucherify experience not only seamless but also secure. Let us dive into easy ways to keep your digital journey worry-free.

### Built-in mechanisms

The built-in mechanisms in Voucherify can be divided into two categories:

- account-wide
- campaign-wide

#### Account-wide mechanisms

1. Account security 

Take proactive steps such as enabling two-factor authentication, SAML authentication, use strong and unique passwords, and regularly update them. These simple yet effective measures will significantly bolster your account's defenses against potential threats. We encourage you to get familiar with the [account security](https://support.voucherify.io/article/437-account-security) guide. 

2. IP whitelisting

> Enterprise feature available upon request

This functionality, available only upon request for customers on the Enterprise plan, provides an additional layer of security by filtering and allowing API requests exclusively from an authorized list of IP addresses.

Navigate to Project Settings→General→Application Keys and edit a Key. This will allow you to restrict the API keys to a specific list of IP addresses. By default, when the list is empty, access to the API through the API keys is allowed from any IP address.

#### Campaign-wide mechanisms

Use Voucherify's campaign creation process and validation rules to restrict coupon usage and make redemptions a reliable measure of campaign success. Take a look at several examples that will help you fight the most commmon forms of coupon abuse in our ['How to Prevent Coupon Fraud and Abuse'](https://www.voucherify.io/blog/how-to-prevent-coupon-fraud-and-abuse) article.

### Additional protective layers

Add your own protective layers on top of what Voucherify has to offer.

One way of preventing fraud can be achieved by setting thresholds for failed code redemption attempts, you can automatically lock or temporarily suspend the user after a certain number of unsuccessful tries. This simple yet effective strategy helps safeguard against brute force attacks.

### External services

Leveraging third-party platforms, advanced artificial intelligence, and specialized tools is crucial for a robust fraud prevention strategy.

Voucherify lets you generate referral codes, allowing customers to refer others and earn rewards. To prevent abuse, you can set validation rules in the campaign that exlude specific customer groups from redeeming referral codes. However, the referral program can still be exploited by setting up fake accounts. This is why Voucherify explored methods and third-party tools to address this issue and enhance fraud prevention of your referral programs.

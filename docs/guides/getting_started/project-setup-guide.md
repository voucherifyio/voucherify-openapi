> ðŸ“˜ Europe region
>
> Remember that if your organization sells products or services to customers based in the EU, you must adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Managing roles and inviting users

Manage your team roles and invite your team members:
1. Click your name in the upper tab.
2. Go to **Team Settings**.
3. Go to **Roles** to manage the roles.
4. Go to **Team** to invite members and assign roles to them. <!-- I'm leaving this as simple as that because a new V% user won't have many projects -->

## Playing around in the Sandbox

Make your [first API call](doc:quickstart) and explore the [Sandbox project](doc:testing). See the test campaigns with pre-defined validation rules to learn Voucherify possibilities.

Create campaigns and experiment with Voucherify.

## Postman Collection

Take a look at the Voucherify [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/workspace/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/31663208-927de30f-b9ba-4723-a7ad-9984d835d939), where you can test examples of the basic processes required to integrate Voucherify with your system, advanced interactions, and industry-specific cases.

## Enabling distributions

Voucherify makes launching and tracking digital promotions easy. Get the documentation, sample code, and developer tools you need to build exactly what you want, fast. We will handle the complexity of promotions delivery and validation. Letâ€™s get building!

## What is Voucherify?

Voucherify is an API-first Promotion Engine for digital teams. With our programmable building blocks, you can launch and manage promotions personalized with customer and session data. This includes coupons, gift cards, in-cart promotions, giveaways, referrals, and loyalty programs. 

Voucherify offers a REST-based API and a web dashboard to create and manage promotional campaigns. Our dedicated endpoints help you deliver personalized incentives to any channel, device, and e-commerce solution while keeping your data in secure, highly available environments. This is achieved with real-time data synchronization with CRM, product inventory, distribution channels, and any customer touchpoints.

The majority of development work is required at the beginning: 
* Connecting the Promotion Engine to the checkout.
* Synchronizing customer data.
* Connecting distribution channels.
* Integrating with BI tools. 

When the integration is done, you can use API to automate and scale campaigns. 

The easiest way to create campaigns is to use the [Campaign Manager](https://support.voucherify.io/article/17-how-do-i-create-my-first-campaign). However, some advanced workflows may require you to use the API and develop your integration over time.

This is why the crucial part is to align your implementation priorities with your business goals.
[This guide](https://success.voucherify.io/article/373-overview) will help you plan this process with your developers and estimate the expected delivery time.

## What can I do in Voucherify?

One of the Voucherify principles is giving your team flexibility. You can start small with a simple coupon campaign and iterate on adding more advanced promotional workflows as you go.

The following examples are meant to give you an overview of what is possible. Keep in mind that there are more options and each workflow can be customized to fit your business logic. 

| **Building block** | **Use cases and features** |
|:---|:---|
| **Coupon campaigns** with:<br><br>- Percentage <br>- Amount <br>- Unit (free items) <br>- Free shipping <br>- Fixed price on item/order | - 10% off if you spend at least $50. <br>- Buy product A and get product B for free. <br>- Each three-pack from category A is now $29.90. <br>- The first order is shipped for free. <br>- Automatic welcome messages with a coupon sent to every new customer. |

| **Giveaways** | - Fill the form and join the lottery, every 100th registered user wins. |

## Get the job done

Assuming your integration allows for a [basic coupon redemption](doc:quickstart), you can now wrap your head around more advanced Voucherify entities and features. These will help you understand how to design a robust promotion system and how to integrate it with your e-commerce & CRM infrastructure.

  * Check out Voucherify [data import](doc:import-codes) capabilities.
  * Learn how to use validation rules based on the data you want to import/sync:
      - [Customer segments](doc:customers#segments) 
      - [Products](doc:products) 
      - [Order structure](doc:orders) 
  * Get familiar with [metadata](doc:metadata-custom-fields). Every object in Voucherify can be extended with custom fields. You can use them for customer segment filters, validation rules, and reporting purposes.  
  * Once you have validation rules configured, learn how to define a discount or incentive with the [Campaign Manager](https://support.voucherify.io/article/511-discount-effects-cheat-sheet).
  * [Deliver](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work) your promotions to customers. Learn how you can share the promotion and what channels are available.
  * Decide what redemption endpoint you prefer to use. Voucherify API supports the [Redeem Voucher](ref:redeem-voucher) of a single promo code and [Stacking discounts](doc:manage-stackable-discounts) for up to 5 incentives per API call.

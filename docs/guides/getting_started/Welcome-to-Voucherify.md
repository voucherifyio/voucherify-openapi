## Platform overview

Voucherify is an API-first Promotions and Loyalty Engine that helps brands run personalized [coupons](https://www.voucherify.io/coupon-software "Voucherify coupon software"), [gift cards](https://www.voucherify.io/gift-cards "Voucherify gift cards"), [auto-applied promotions](https://www.voucherify.io/discount-promotions "Voucherify discount promotions"), [loyalty programs](https://www.voucherify.io/loyalty-software "Voucherify loyalty programs"), and [referral campaigns](https://www.voucherify.io/referral-programs "Voucherify referral programs"). 

Voucherify gives you access to a collection of promotion & loyalty **REST API endpoints** and **a visual Dashboard**. 

Every integration is unique – however, at its core, the integration of Voucherify with your system relies on **passing relevant context to Voucherify API**, which validates and redeems incentives and rewards in accordance with the rules you set up with the Rules Engine.

As a [MACH-certified vendor](https://machalliance.org/), Voucherify follows the principles of **composability**, giving you flexibility and decreasing the time needed for integration.

## Who uses Voucherify and why?

Voucherify can be successfully adopted across industries in B2C and B2B contexts – from ecommerce to travel and mobile on-demand services.

Leveraging targeted promotions at every stage of the customer lifecycle can help you maximize engagement. This way, you can acquire customers through social media promotion, convert them with a welcome offer, grow them as customers via referrals, and ultimately, build better retention tactics with smart loyalty campaigns and re-engage them with incentives tailored to their profiles. This is the perfect scenario that each brand should aspire to achieve. But to get there, you need proper technology.

## Retail – Ecommerce & POS


Voucherify is perfect for ecommerce brands transitioning to MACH and building a standard tech stack for their brands. We work great with commercetools and other MACH tools when it comes to scaling across multiple countries/brands, including integrating various business models (DTC, B2B, marketplace).

Voucherify enhances store capabilities with advanced promotions, crucial for revenue. At the same time, Voucherify opens the door to loyalty and referral programs without the need to integrate any additional platform.

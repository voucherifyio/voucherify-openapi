## Who uses Voucherify and why?

Voucherify can be successfully adopted across industries in B2C and B2B contexts: e-commerce, travel, or mobile on-demand services.

Applying targeted promotions at every stage of the customer lifecycle can help you maximize engagement. This way, you can acquire customers through social media promotion, convert them with a welcome offer, grow them as customers with referrals, and ultimately, build better retention tactics with loyalty campaigns and re-engage them with incentives that match their profiles. This is the perfect scenario that each brand should aspire to achieve. But to get there, you need proper technology.

However, every integration is unique. At its core, the integration of Voucherify with your system relies on **passing relevant context to Voucherify API**, which validates and redeems incentives and rewards in accordance with the rules you set up with the Rules Engine.

As a [MACH-certified vendor](https://machalliance.org/), Voucherify follows the principles of **composability**, giving you flexibility and decreasing the time needed for integration. This way, you can more easily combine Voucherify with you existing tech-stack that may include:
- Customer Data Platform (CDP)
- Customer Engagement Platform (CEP)
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions
- Customer Management System (CMS)
- Distribution tools
- Marketing automation platforms

## What problems does Voucherify solve?

Thanks to Voucherify, you can solve the following issues:
- Integrating promotions with external tools and dynamic customer touchpoints.
- Paying too much for promotion maintenance and real-time monitoring of all digital offers.
- Generating unsatisfactory ROI caused by generic offers, low-key loyalty programs, and promotional fraud.
- Continuously mediating between marketing and development teams' priorities. 
- Writing extra code to keep multiple promotion and loyalty platforms in sync across applications, brands, and teams.
- Struggling to build branded customer-facing UIs using legacy and monolithic services <!-- Is this still true since we've removed LP and are about to get rid of cockpits?-->
- Failing to effectively manage traffic spikes and priority changes.
<!-- Anything else? -->

You can achieve this thanks to Voucherify's promotion and loyalty **REST API endpoints** and **a visual Dashboard** to help you with configuration.

## REST API

Thanks to the [Voucherify API](ref:introduction-1), you can support your system or tech-stack with a platform that creates different promotional campaigns. In a basic scenario, Voucherify can show your customers if they are eligible to the incentives you offer them with qualification, check if they can apply them through validation, and then handle incentive use with redemption.

You can pick whatever you need from the API and build your integration in a smart way.

Additionally, you can use webhooks to better track customer activity or even how your promotional campaigns are managed.

<!-- Mention configurable webhooks when it's done -->

## Visual dashboard

You can manage your promotional campaigns with a visual dashboard. With Voucherify dashboard, you can set up your marketing and development team, projects, campaigns, rules, and more.

Developers use Voucherify dashboard to get API keys, manage integrations with other platforms, and configure integration-sensitive details, like metadata schemas. Marketers, on the other hand, use the dashboard to create and manage promotional campaigns.

User management starts with mapping how various departments, such as marketing, customer support, and engineering, can **collaborate to create and maintain Voucherify campaigns**. To restrict access to campaigns, Voucherify provides **four layers of protection**:

* **Default and custom user roles** – Admin, User, Viewer, Merchant, and Custom with fine-grained rights.
* **Approval workflows** – requesting campaign approval with email and in-app notifications.
* **Separate API keys** – each user can have separate API keys. You can also add separate API keys per integration. 
* **Account security** – MFA and SAML. 

> 📘 Access and users
>
> Each project can have separate access options. Voucherify also does not limit the number of users within the account.

# Distributions

> ðŸ“˜ Goals
> * Identify which channels should be used for distribution.
> * Learn how Voucherify publication works.
> * Discover Voucherify integrations for messaging.

## Outcome: 

Connect Voucherify with your preferred communication channels.

Evaluate your customer journey and think of places and times the information about the deal should be displayed: website, product pages, emails, SMS, push, print, partners, or social media. Think of how you want to remind customers about the deals theyâ€™re eligible to use. Voucherify offers two distribution modes:

* Pull â€“ you can use API to get promotions in front of customers (e.g., list all active coupons for John Doe).

* Push â€“  an integral distribution mechanism that you can use to define a trigger for the message send-out (e.g., if John Doe signs up for a newsletter, send him a 10% off promo code).

Both push and pull modes can be used with 3rd party platforms.

> ðŸ“˜ Publication means incentive assignment. Typically, a publication is performed by sharing codes with customers (via Publication API).

Evaluate your customer journey and **think of places and times the information about the deal should be displayed**: website, product pages, emails, SMS, push, print, partners, or social media. Think of how you want to remind customers about the deals theyâ€™re eligible to use. Voucherify offers **two distribution modes**:

* **Pull** â€“ you can use API to get promotions in front of customers (e.g., list all active coupons for John Doe).
* **Push** â€“ an integral distribution mechanism that you can use to define a trigger for the message send-out (e.g., if John Doe signs up for a newsletter, send him a 10% off promo code).

Both push and pull modes can be used with 3rd party platforms.

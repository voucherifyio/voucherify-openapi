Voucherify offers a variety of tools to keep you informed about **campaign performance, ROI, budget spent, and API usage** – real-time and within a specific period. The tracking covers aggregate data and the ability to browse through single events. Voucherify also provides a global perspective, showing the overall performance of all campaigns within a project.

* **Redemption tracking** – analyze when redemptions fail and why.
* **Campaign performance** – each campaign type has a predefined set of relevant analytics.
* **360-degree customer profile view** – personal details, order summary, events, promotions, and loyalty activities.
* **Audit logs** – for debugging system integrations.

## Multi-brand management & internationalization

> ðŸ“˜ **Goals**
> 
> * Understand how Voucherify supports multiple brands and locations through projects.

**Outcome**: 

Ability to set up separate projects for different locations, currencies, brands, or development phases.

---

Voucherify supports **different approaches to campaign management**. You can use multiple projects to map different contexts or a shared project by using categories, labels, promo code prefixes, or custom fields to differentiate campaigns. Learn how projects can be used to isolate business context and its impact on maintenance and reporting:

* Currency & timezone.
* Users and user roles.
* Email settings & marketing consents.
* Metadata schema.
* Categories. 
* API keys, usage & webhooks.

> ðŸ“˜ Voucherify Management API
> 
> Voucherify offers a Management API which allows large teams to manage projects via API, for instance, to set up new projects 
under a specific configuration fully programmatically.

Voucherify enables programmable export of [vouchers](ref:get-voucher), [redemptions](ref:get-redemption), [publications](ref:list-publications), [customers](ref:get-customer), [order](ref:get-order) and point expirations to a CSV file. Here are four simple steps to achieve it:

1. Trigger the export with [Create Export](ref:create-export) and store the `id` of [the export object](ref:get-export) you'll get in the response from Voucherify.

2. [Get](ref:get-export) the export's status providing the `id` and take a look at the `status` field from the response. If it's still `SCHEDULED`, this means that the export is still in progress and you should ask later.

3. When the status is finally `DONE`, the `result` will store the URL as in the example below: 


```json Response
{
  "id": "export_lhZvHKphiMESVdIncRKvoaZh",
  "object": "export",
  "created_at": "2017-02-24T14:03:00.196Z",
  "status": "DONE",
  "channel": "API",
  "exported_object": "voucher",
  "parameters": {
    "fields": [
      "code",
      "voucher_type"
    ],
    "filter": {
      "categories": {
        "conditions": {
          "$in": [
            "postman"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "result": {
    "url": "https://download.voucherify.io/v1/exports/export_lhZvHKphiMESVdIncRKvoaZh?token=TOKEN"
  }
}
```

4. To [download the export file](ref:download-export), use the provided URL together with authentication headers.

## Filters

Voucherify allows you to specify the timeframe for the records you want to retrieve. Thanks to this mechanism it should be easy to implement a pagination mechanism. See the example of a request body: 


```json Request
{
   "exported_object":"redemption",
   "parameters":{
      "order":"-created_at",
      "fields":[
         "id",
         "object",
         "date",
         "voucher_code",
         "customer_id",
         "result"
      ],
      "filters":{
         "junction":"and",
         "created_at":{
            "conditions":{
               "$after":[
                  "2018-05-30T22:00:00.000Z"
               ],
               "$before":[
                  "2018-06-29T22:00:00.000Z"
               ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

The export request will almost always result in a single file being generated by the system. However, if the volume of data is large, the system can split the results into multiple chunks.

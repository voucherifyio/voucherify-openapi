Voucherify makes it easy to import legacy coupon codes. After a successful import operation, the uploaded codes will be recognized as valid and will inherit the discount definition from a given campaign.

There are two ways of importing codes into Voucherify â€“programmable and with the import tool. 

> ðŸ“˜ Dashboard mode
> 
> See how to use the import tool [here] (https://support.voucherify.io/article/45-import-codes-and-share-them-digitally).

## Import through the API

The programmable mode handles both on JSON and CSV payload. There're 4 endpoints that handle the import of:

* Standalone vouchers: [JSON](ref:import-vouchers) | [CSV](ref:import-vouchers-using-csv). 
* Vouchers assigned to a given campaign: [JSON](ref:import-vouchers-to-campaign) | [CSV](ref:import-vouchers-to-campaign-using-csv).

> ðŸ“˜ Postman Collection
>
> You can play around with this endpoint with our [Postman examples](doc:examples) â€“ catalog `Import`.

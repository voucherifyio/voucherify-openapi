Your API version controls the API and webhook behavior you see (e.g., what properties you see in responses, what parameters youâ€™re permitted to send in requests, etc.). Your version is set the first time you make an API request. When we change the API in a backwards-incompatible way, we release a new dated version, but to avoid breaking your code, we donâ€™t change your version until youâ€™re ready to upgrade.

## How can I upgrade my API?

If youâ€™re running an older version, youâ€™ll want to upgrade to take advantage of the latest API. For changing your API version, go to your Project Settings and click** Upgrade to the latest API version**.

## Changes which Voucherify considers to be backwards-compatible

- Adding new API resources.
- Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
- Adding new properties to existing API responses.
- Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
- Changing the length or format of object IDs or other opaque strings. 
- Adding new event types. It means that your webhook listener should gracefully handle unfamiliar events types.

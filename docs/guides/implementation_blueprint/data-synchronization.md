In Voucherify, you can synchronize the following data:
- [Customers](#customer-synchronization)
- [Products](#product-synchronization)
- [Orders](#order-synchronization)
<!-- - [Campaigns and vouchers](#campaigns-and-vouchers) -->

When you have [created your Voucherify account](doc:getting-started), you can import your existing data and then synchronize it for future use in campaigns.

> ðŸ“˜ **Goals**:
>
> - Learn why data synchronization is important
> - Learn how to synchronize your data through data import and updates

**Outcome**:

Your data is synchronized with Voucherify.

<!-- Trying this approach for a test. If it's liked, we can add it throughout the docs. Otherwise, I'll delete it. -->

## Customer synchronization

Voucherify uses the [customer object](ref:customer-object) for [validation](ref:validation-object), [redemption](ref:redemption-object), and [distribution](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work "How does the distribution manager work?") purposes.

<!-- instead of distribution - publication? -->

The customer data does not have to be stored in Voucherify before a validation or redemption request is made. Voucherify can use the customer data from the request to create a new customer with a unique `id` field.

However, the customer data must exist in Voucherify before a distribution is made.

<!-- distribution as meant by distribution channels, not publication, as in the postman collection? -->

<!-- this bit must be moved someplace

Every customer has unique identification data in the `source_id` field. The `source_id` can be a customer ID or email from a CRM system, database, or a third-party service.  It can be imported into Voucherify from your [CRM database]() or a CSV file <!-- link when ready! -->.

-->

> ðŸš§
>
> Note that if your data are to be synchronized based on the `source_id` of the customer, you need to import the `source_id` when the customer is uploaded for the first time. You will not be able to change or update `source_id` later on.

### Synchronization options

#### Upserting customers

If the customer does not exist in Voucherify, they are created (upserted) automatically in a request that includes the customer object. If the customer exists, their data will be updated. In this case, the response also includes the `created_at` and `updated_at` objects. <!-- these are objects, right? -->

The following actions upsert customer data:
- order creation
- voucher publication
- redemption


<!-- Redemption... but this is to be deprecated, right? so should we actually link/mention those -->

##### Order creation

##### Voucher publication

##### Redemption

#### Importing customers

#### Creating and updating customers via the API

#### Synchronizing with connectors

### Customer API endpoints

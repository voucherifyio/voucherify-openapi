In Voucherify, you can synchronize the following data:
- [Customers](#customer-synchronization)
- [Products](#product-synchronization)
- [Orders](#order-synchronization)
<!-- - [Campaigns and vouchers](#campaigns-and-vouchers) -->

When you have [created your Voucherify account](doc:getting-started), you can import your existing data and then synchronize it for future use in campaigns.

> ðŸ“˜ **Goals**:
>
> - Learn why data synchronization is important
> - Learn how to synchronize your data through data import and updates

**Outcome**:

Your data is synchronized with Voucherify.

<!-- Trying this approach for a test. If it's liked, we can add it throughout the docs. Otherwise, I'll delete it. -->

## Customer synchronization

Voucherify uses the [customer object](ref:customer-object) for [validation](ref:validation-object), [redemption](ref:redemption-object), and [distribution](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work "How does the distribution manager work?") purposes.

<!-- instead of distribution - publication? -->

The customer data does not have to be stored in Voucherify before a validation or redemption request is made. Voucherify can use the customer data from the request to create a new customer with a unique `id` field.

However, the customer data must exist in Voucherify before a distribution is made.

<!-- distribution as meant by distribution channels, not publication, as in the postman collection? -->

<!-- this bit must be moved someplace

Every customer has unique identification data in the `source_id` field. The `source_id` can be a customer ID or email from a CRM system, database, or a third-party service.  It can be imported into Voucherify from your [CRM database]() or a CSV file <!-- link when ready! -->

> ðŸš§ Customer data synchronization and `source_id`
>
> If your data is to be synchronized based on the `source_id` of the customer, you need to import the `source_id` when the customer is uploaded for the first time. You will not be able to change or update `source_id` later on.

### Synchronization options

<!-- https://success.voucherify.io/article/430-crm-playbook

 -->

#### Upserting customers

<!-- do we clarify what `upsert` means: `update` + `insert`? -->

If the customer does not exist in Voucherify, they are created automatically in a request that includes the customer object. If the customer exists, their data will be upserted. In this case, the response also includes the `updated_at` object. <!-- these are objects, right? -->

The following actions upsert customer data:
- order creation
- voucher publication
- validation <!-- IMO should be here-->
- redemption

<!-- Redemption... but this is to be deprecated, right? so should we actually link/mention those

I need clarification â€“ we want customers to use qualification endpoint or the stackable discounts endpoint, and these do redeem, so is this info `redemption` all right?

Anything else that MUST be here? I don't mean everything

-->

<!-- ##### Order creation

##### Voucher publication

##### Redemption

-->

#### Importing customers

You can import your customer database to Voucherify with a CSV file. If you use a CRM system, use its unique ID as a `source_id` field.

Read our [customer import guide](https://support.voucherify.io/article/67-how-to-import-my-customers#csv-import "How to import my customers?") to learn more.

<!-- Should I write a full step-by-step manual for this? -->

#### Creating and updating customers via the API

If you want to keep your customers database in up to date with Voucherify, create a customer in Voucherify every time a new user is added to your database. Use the [Create customer API method](ref:create-customer) to upsert customer data.

<!-- Simply repeat the endpoints? -->

#### Synchronizing with connectors

Customer data can be upserted with integrated platforms that support outbound traffic:
- Batch
- Bloomreach Engagement
- Intercom
- Klaviyo
- MoEngage
- mParticle
- Salesforce
- Segment
- ZOHO

<!-- Again, clarification: do we want to add only those platforms that send customer 
data to Voucherify, right? 

I'll update the links once these get clarified

Also: how to know which platform sends data to V% and which receives V% data?

-->

### Customer API endpoints

<!-- TBChecked which are still supported and if this list is still up-to-date; taken from https://success.voucherify.io/article/430-crm-playbook -->

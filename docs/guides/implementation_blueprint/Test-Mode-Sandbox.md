Each Voucherify account has a Sandbox project which is not included in your project limit. You can use it to run your use cases and try out Voucherify capabilities. 

Sandbox projects have their unique API keys for authorization.

## How to use the Sandbox project

Sandbox is the default project when you create a new Voucherify account. 

If you upgrade to a paid plan, Sandbox will be visible in your projects list and it won't be counted to your limit.

In **Project settings > Application keys**, you can see API keys necessary to [authorize](doc:authentication) API requests. 

> üìò API calls limit
> 
> Sandbox has a fixed API calls limit set to 100 calls per hour. Sandbox API requests are not counted into your account limits of API calls.

### Demo shop

Sandbox is connected to a showcase demo shop. The demo shop presents how the integration between Voucherify and customer touchpoints might look in practice. 

With this setup, you can create campaigns and immediately see how they work at the checkout. For example, you can validate and redeem codes from created campaigns to test different promo scenarios and validation rules. Each redemption will be tracked in the dashboard.

To access the demo shop, go to your Sandbox project and click the Demo Shop button in the top bar.

### Test data

Sandbox is populated with test campaigns, standalone codes, customers, and products. For example:

| **Campaigns:** |  |
|:---|:---|
| 15% off for Illy - Arabica (Discount coupons) | 15% off Illy Arabica (test product) |

#### Sandbox Keys

To use the Sandbox API, you need to obtain Application Keys for the Sandbox Environment. Go to [configuration section](https://app.voucherify.io/#/app/configuration/proj_f1r5Tpr0J3Ct), then in the Application Keys section switch the Environment to Sandbox:

#### Sandbox vs production environment

The Sandbox API includes the same endpoints as the production API. However, note the following differences:

‚ùó  Vouchers created through the Sandbox API are **not visible** in the [web application](https://app.voucherify.io).

‚ùó  Codes of vouchers created through the Sandbox API are prefixed with `voucherify.io-`.

‚ùó  Redemptions performed on sandbox vouchers don't count to the monthly [limits](doc:limits).

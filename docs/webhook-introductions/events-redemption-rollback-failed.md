The `REDEMPTION.ROLLBACK.FAILED` webhook means that a redemption was unsuccessfully reverted.

This occurs when the system encounters difficulties in rolling back a previously redeemed voucher code or promotional tier. The main reasons are that a rollback was applied to a redemption created more than 3 months ago or an attempt was made to rollback a redemption that had been rolled back already.

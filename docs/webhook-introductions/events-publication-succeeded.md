The `EVENTS.PUBLICATION.SUCCEEDED` event indicates that a voucher code was successfully published to a customer.

This webhook serves as a real-time notification mechanism and it can notify other systems or applications that a voucher was assigned. As a result, the systems can react by, for example, sending a notification about an assignment to a customer.

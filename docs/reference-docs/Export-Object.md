`/exports` endpoint allows you to retrieve Voucherify objects such as [vouchers](ref:the-voucher-object), [redemptions](ref:the-redemption-object), [publications](ref:publish-voucher), [customers](ref:the-customer-object), and points expirations as a CSV file. This functionality works **asynchronously** and comes down to 3 steps:
* create an export object and return its `id` so you can track its `status`
* trigger a CSV file generation, change the status to `SCHEDULED`
* when the generation is over, store the file in S3 and change the `status` to `DONE` (now you can [get](ref:get-export) it)

With `parameters` you can select which `fields` will be exported and `filter` out the relevant data

```
  {
    "fields": [
      "code",
      "voucher_type"
    ],
    "filters": {
      "categories": {
        "conditions": {
          "$in": [
            "postman"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
```


## Fields values
Here is a list of the fields you can export for particular objects.

## Pagination and example request
Voucherify allows you to specify the timeframe for the records you want to retrieve. Thanks to this mechanism it should easy to implement a pagination mechanism. See the example of request body:

```json Request body
 {
   "exported_object":"redemption",
   "parameters":{
      "order":"-created_at", // results start from the latest resources, "created_at" sorts from the oldest to the newest resources
      "fields":[
         "id",
         "object",
         "date",
         "voucher_code",
         "customer_id",
         "result"
      ],
      "filters":{
         "junction":"and",
         "created_at":{
            "conditions":{
               "$after":[
                  "2018-05-30T22:00:00.000Z"
               ],
               "$before":[
                  "2018-06-29T22:00:00.000Z"
               ]
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

An export request will almost always result in a single file being generated by the system. However, in the case when your volume of data is large, the system can split the results into multiple chunks.

If you need to migrate referral codes from another system, you can use the **Import CSV tool** in the Dashboard.

The tool enables you to:

- Import new referral codes into a campaign.
- Update selected attributes of existing referral codes.

## Preparing CSV file for referral codes

<Info>

<Badge color="gray">Referral campaign prerequisite</Badge>

Before importing, create a referral campaign in Voucherify.

</Info>

Referral codes can only be imported into an existing referral campaign.  

Imported codes inherit campaign settings unless explicitly overridden.

Use the <a href="/examples/import-referral-codes-template.csv" download>CSV referral code file template</a> for faster preparation.

### Required fields

- **Code**: A unique referral code value. You cannot import two identical codes into a single Voucherify project.

### Optional fields

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the referral code.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

  Import behavior:
  - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted, imported codes are set to `TRUE`.
  - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted, imported codes are set to `FALSE`.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the referral code for filtering and organization.

- **Redeemed quantity**  
  The number of times the referral code has already been redeemed. If omitted, the value defaults to `0`. This works only for new codes.

- **Start date**
  The date and time when the referral code becomes active. 
  
  Accepted format: ISO 8601 (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`). If omitted, the referral code is active immediately upon creation.

- **Expiration date**
  The date and time when the referral code is no longer valid for redemption.
  
  Accepted format: ISO 8601. Once this date passes, the referral code status automatically changes to `Expired`.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**  

  <MetadataImport/>

  Metadata import behavior:
  - If metadata columns are omitted, the referral code inherits the campaign’s metadata.
  - If metadata columns are added and mapped, only those specific fields are overridden.
  - Metadata that is not mapped remains unchanged.

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

</Note>

All unmapped attributes inherit the campaign’s default settings, including validation rules, reward logic, and time limits.

## Updating existing referral codes

You can re-import existing referral codes to update them.

When importing existing referral codes:

- Only **Active** status and **Category** can be updated.
- Other attributes remain unchanged.

<Warning>

  Referral code values cannot be changed. To replace a code, create a new one.

</Warning>

## Import referral codes to a campaign

In **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**, open your referral campaign.

In the top-right corner, use the three-dot menu to **Import CSV file**.

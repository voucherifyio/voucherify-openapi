If you need to share referral codes from other sources with Voucherify, you can handle this scenario using the Import CSV tool in the Dashboard.

The tool enables you to import:

- New referral codes into a campaign.
- Existing referral codes to update selected fields.

## Preparing CSV file for referral codes

Referral codes can only be imported into an existing referral campaign.

Before importing, make sure you have a referral campaign created in Voucherify.
</Info>

Use these fields when importing referral codes into a campaign.  
Imported codes inherit campaign settings unless explicitly overridden.

### Required fields

- **Code**  
  A unique referral code value.  
  You cannot import two identical codes into a single Voucherify project.

### Optional fields

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the referral code.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.  
  An inactive referral code cannot be redeemed, even if it is within its validity timeframe.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the referral code.  
  Categories help you filter and organize codes in the Dashboard.

- **Redeemed quantity**  
  The number of times the referral code has already been redeemed.  
  If omitted, the value defaults to `0`.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**  

  <MetadataImport/>

  Metadata import behavior:

  - If metadata columns are omitted, the referral code inherits the campaign’s metadata.
  - If metadata columns are added and mapped, only those specific fields are overridden.
  - Metadata that is not mapped remains unchanged.

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

</Note>

All unmapped attributes inherit the campaign’s default settings, including validation rules and time limits.

## Updating existing referral codes

You can re-import the same referral codes to update them.

When importing existing referral codes:

- Only **Active** status and **Category** can be updated.
- Other attributes remain unchanged.

<Warning>

Referral code values themselves cannot be changed.  
To replace a code, you must create a new one.

</Warning>

## Import referral codes to a campaign

In **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**, go to the referral campaign where you want to import the codes.  
In the top right corner, use the three-dot menu to **Import CSV file**.

This guide provides task-oriented guidance on configuring a cart-level promotion campaign in Voucherify, covering the seven steps shown in the campaign builder.

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** to **Create campaign**.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Promotion details

This is the first step where you define the basic settings and timeframe for your promotion.

<CampDetails/>

<TimeFrame/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Discount tiers

Each tier defines a specific discount amount and the rules that must be met to activate it. You can create one or multiple tiers.

For each tier, you must define:

* **Tier name**
* **Banner message** (This message is shown to customers)
* **Category** (Used for stacking rules)
* **Tier timeframe** (Optional; if not set, it inherits the campaign timeframe)

<DiscConfig/>

<Tip>

You can quickly generate a new discount tier based on a pre-defined **Campaign template**. This feature allows you to reuse configuration settings for a tier that is commonly used across different campaigns, saving setup time.

To learn more about pre-configured discount structures, see the [Campaign Templates guide](https://support.voucherify.io/article/620-campaign-templates).

</Step>

<Step>

## Discounts application rules

This section determines how the different tiers you defined in the previous step interact with each other. Voucherify supports two main application modes: **Tiers only** and **Stacks**.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Tiers only (default)">

**Purpose**: To ensure that only the single best-qualified discount tier is applied to the customer's cart. 

**How it works**:

**Single Application**: Only one tier can apply to the cart, even if the cart technically qualifies for several. 

**Hierarchy-Driven**: The system typically uses the Promotions hierarchy (the next step in the builder) to determine which tier is applied, prioritizing the highest one on the list. 

**Outcome**: The customer receives the maximum benefit from a single tier, but discounts are not combined. 

</Tab>

<Tab title="Tiers and stacks">

**Purpose**: To combine multiple individual discount tiers into one unified promotion that applies together. 

<Tip> Think of a stack as a "bundle of tiers" that act as one combined promotion.  </Tip>

**How it works**:

**Grouping Tiers**: You select Create combined promotion to group tiers into a stack. 

**Combined Discounts**: This mode allows you to combine multiple tiers and apply them together. 

**Use Case**: Stacks are useful for creating complex incentives like applying "10% off + free shipping" in a single action. 

**Application Sequence**: The order of the tiers within the stack determines the sequence of tier redemptions during a single-order transaction. 

**Limit**: A single promotion stack can have a maximum number of 30 tiers. 

### How to create a combined promotion stack

Follow these steps to group your defined tiers into a single, combined promotion:

1. **Create combined promotion** option located **below** the main discount application rules will allow you to create and define a promotion stack.
2. In the **Create combined promotion** dialog, enter a descriptive name in the **Name** field (e.g., *Summer Stack*).
3. (Optional) Select a **Category** for the stack. This is used for stacking rules later.
4. In the **Selected Tiers** field, use the dropdown to select and add the specific discount tiers you want to include in this stack.
5. Once added, use the up/down arrows next to the tiers to set the application order. The tier at the top of the list is applied first in the transaction sequence.
6. **Save** to finalize and add the promotion stack to the campaign.

## Promotions hierarchy

If a customer's cart qualifies for multiple discount tiers (that are *not* inside a stack), this section allows you to set the order in which the tier discounts are applied.

Use the arrows to place the highest priority tier at the top of the list and set the rest in the correct order. The tier at the top will be applied first.

</Step>

<Step>

## Metadata (optional)

Metadata allows you to attach custom data to your promotion for internal tracking or advanced segmentation.

<MetadataConfig/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Access settings

Define who can view and manage this promotion within the Voucherify dashboard.

<AccessSettings/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Summary

Review all your settings before launching the campaign.

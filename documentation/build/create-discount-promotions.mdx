This is a step-by-step guide on configuring a cart-level promotion campaign in Voucherify, covering all steps shown in the campaign builder.

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** to **Create campaign** and select **Promotion**.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Promotion details

Define the basic settings and timeframe for your promotion.

<Step>

## Discount tiers

Each **Discount tier** defines a specific discount amount and the rules that must be met to activate it. You can create one or multiple tiers.

**Create tier** to configure the promotion tier.

<Steps>

    <Step title="Details">
    Define **Details**:
    1. **Tier name**.
    2. **Banner message**: Optional; message shown to customers.
    3. **Category**: Optional; used for stacking rules.
    4. **Tier timeframe**: Optional; if not set, it inherits the campaign timeframe.

<Tip>

<Badge color="green">Create Tier from Template</Badge>

You can generate a new discount tier based on a defined **Campaign template**. Templates allow you to reuse configuration settings for a tier that is commonly used across different campaigns, saving setup time.

You can use templates from a discount campaign or a promotion tier to create a new discount tier.

To learn more about pre-configured discount structures, see the [Campaign Templates guide](https://support.voucherify.io/article/620-campaign-templates).

## Discounts application rules

This section determines how the different tiers you defined in the previous step interact with each other. Voucherify supports two main application modes: **Tiers only** and **Tiers and stacks**.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Tiers only">

This is the default setting. Only individual promotion tiers can be used.

You can use one or many tiers in your promotion activities.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Tiers and stacks">

You can combine multiple individual discount tiers into one unified promotion stack that applies together. In your promotion activities, you can also use promotion stacks together with separate promotion tiers.

<Tip>

    A promotion stack works like a bundle of promotion tiers that act as one combined promotion.

    Promotion stacks are useful for creating complex incentives like applying "10% off + free shipping" in a single action. 

</Tip>

**Create combined promotion** and:
1. Enter **Name** (for example, *Summer stack*).
2. Optionally, select **Category** for the stack or create a new one.
3. In the **Selected Tiers** dropdown, select discount tiers to include them in this stack.
5. Once added, use the up/down arrows to set the application order. The tier at the top of the list is applied first in the transaction sequence.
6. **Save** to add the promotion stack to the campaign.

You can add many promotion stacks to the campaign.

<Info>

    A single promotion stack can have up to 30 tiers.

## Promotions hierarchy

If a customer's cart qualifies for multiple discount tiers, you can set the order in which the tier discounts are applied.

Use the arrows to place the highest priority tier at the top of the list and set the rest in the correct order. The tier at the top will be applied first.

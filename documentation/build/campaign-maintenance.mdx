Use the campaign dashboard to manage your campaigns after launch. You can track performance, enable or disable codes, clone campaigns, and export data for analysis.

## Access the campaign dashboard

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** and select a campaign name to open its dashboard.

From the dashboard, you can:

- View real-time performance metrics
- Manage individual codes (vouchers, loyalty cards, referral codes, gift cards)
- Edit campaign settings
- Set up distributions
- Export campaign data

<Note>
Managing individual codes refers to enabling, disabling, deleting, and exporting campaign assets. While loyalty cards are not always labeled as “codes” in the UI, they are managed in a similar way from the dashboard.
</Note>

## Manage campaigns

### Enable or disable a campaign

A disabled campaign prevents all redemptions and reward triggering. Vouchers, gift cards, referral rewards, and loyalty rewards from a disabled campaign cannot be redeemed or issued until you re-enable it.

Disabling a campaign does **not** remove already issued vouchers, gift card balances, loyalty points, or referral relationships—it only stops further earning, redemption, or reward fulfillment.

1. Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**.
2. Select the campaign name.
3. Select **Disable** to stop redemptions or **Enable** to allow them.

### Clone a campaign

Clone an existing campaign to create a new one with similar settings.

1. Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**.
2. Select the campaign you want to clone.
3. Select **Clone** from the action menu.

<Note>
Referral programs cannot be cloned.
</Note>

### Delete a campaign

1. Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**.
2. Select the campaign name, then select the delete icon. Alternatively, select the three dots (⋮) > **Delete** from the campaign list.
3. Choose a deletion method:
   - **Move to bin**: Prevents reusing the same campaign name and codes in this project. You can restore or permanently delete items from the bin later.
   - **Delete permanently**: Allows you to reuse the campaign name and codes in future campaigns.

<Warning>
Permanent deletion cannot be undone. Choose this option only if you want to reuse the same campaign name or codes.
</Warning>

## Manage vouchers

### Search and filter vouchers

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** > **Vouchers** tab to view all unique codes across your campaigns, including discount coupons, gift cards, referral codes, and loyalty cards.

- **Search by code**: Use the search box to find a specific voucher by its code.
- **Filter vouchers**: Select **Add filter** to narrow results by:
  - Voucher code, type, or status
  - Campaign or campaign status
  - Category
  - Start date, expiration date, creation date, or update date
  - Redeemed quantity
  - Custom metadata attributes

Use **Bulk input** when filtering by metadata with the **in** condition. You can paste up to 200 values separated by colons, semicolons, commas, or newlines.

### Enable or disable individual vouchers

1. Go to the campaign dashboard and open the **Vouchers** tab (or the equivalent tab for your campaign type, such as **Loyalty Cards** or **Referral codes**).
2. Use the toggle button next to a voucher to enable or disable it.

Disabling an individual voucher affects only that specific code and does not impact the rest of the campaign.

### Delete a voucher

1. In the vouchers list, select the three dots (⋮) next to the voucher.
2. Select **Delete**.
3. Choose a deletion method:
   - **Move to bin**: The code cannot be reused until permanently deleted from the bin.
   - **Delete permanently**: The code can be reused immediately.

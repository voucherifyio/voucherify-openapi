If you need to migrate loyalty cards from another system, you can use the **Import CSV tool** in the Dashboard.

The tool enables you to:

- Import new loyalty cards to a campaign.
- Update selected attributes of existing loyalty cards.

## Preparing CSV file for loyalty cards

<Info>

<Badge color="gray">Import loyalty cards prerequisite</Badge>

Before importing loyalty cards, create a [loyalty program](/build/loyalty-campaign-overview).

</Info>

Loyalty cards must be imported into an existing loyalty campaign.  
Imported cards inherit campaign settings unless explicitly overridden.

### Required fields

- **Code**  
  A unique loyalty card code.  
  You cannot import two identical codes into a single Voucherify project.

### Optional fields

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the loyalty card.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

  Import behavior:
  - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted, imported cards are set to `TRUE`.
  - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted, imported cards are set to `FALSE`.

- **Loyalty points**  
  The initial number of points assigned to the card.  

  Important:
  - Points are applied only to newly imported cards.
  - Points of existing cards cannot be updated through CSV import.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the loyalty card for filtering and organization.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**  

  <MetadataImport/>

  Metadata import behavior:
  - If metadata columns are omitted, the loyalty card inherits campaign metadata.
  - If metadata columns are added and mapped, only those specific fields are overridden.
  - Metadata that is not mapped remains unchanged.

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

</Note>

All unmapped attributes inherit the campaign’s default settings, including validation rules, earning rules, expiration policy, and other campaign-level configurations.

## Import behavior for selected attributes

Some attributes work as follows during import:

- **Active**
  - If the campaign is **Active** and `active` is omitted, the imported cards are set to `TRUE`.
  - If the campaign is **Expired** and `active` is omitted, the imported cards are set to `FALSE`.

- **Loyalty points**
  - Applied only to newly created loyalty cards.
  - Not updated for existing cards.

- **Metadata**
  - If omitted, campaign metadata is inherited.
  - If mapped, only specified fields are overridden.

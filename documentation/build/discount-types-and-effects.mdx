## Discount configurator

With the discount configurator, you can set discounts in various Voucherify campaigns.

In the first screen of the discount configurator, you can choose a discount category:

1.  [Order discount](#order-discount-effects)
2.  [Product discounts](#product-discount-effects)
3.  [Rewards](#reward-effects)
4.  [Free shipping](#free-shipping)

When you select a discount category, the configurator of a particular discount category opens and it includes the following sections; different discount categories will have different sections:

![Sections](/images/docs/discount-types-and-effects-01.png "Sections overview")

2.  [Conditions](#conditions-and-validation-rules) step – configure validation rules (optional).
3.  [Discount types](#discount-types) – different in particular discount categories.
4.  [Discount value](#dynamic-discount-values) – static or dynamic; build formula to create a dynamic discount.
5.  Discount maximum limit – available in some discount types; limits how much discount can be applied.

### Amount discount

This discount defines an amount in any currency that will be subtracted from the whole cart or product, for example, \$20 or €10 off. You can set the currency in the [Project Settings](https://support.voucherify.io/article/120-account-settings#general).

The amount can be modified with additional discount limits.

<Note>
<Badge color="blue">Discount currency</Badge>

The currency of your incentives is set per project. Currency settings let you display a discount in a proper format. However, note that Voucherify API is currency-agnostic: currency changes do not impact the way the discounts are calculated.

Read the [Discount dependable on currency](https://support.voucherify.io/article/601-discount-dependable-on-currency) article to learn more about creating different discounts for various currencies.
</Note>

### Percent discount

This discount defines a percentage that will be subtracted from the whole cart or the product, for example, 10% or 50% off. The total discount amount is calculated during the validation, and it is a difference between the initial price and the amount calculated based on the percent value.

The following additional discount limits can be applied to secure the campaign budget:

*   **Maximum discount amount**
*   **Maximum discount amount combined for all order lines**

### New price

This discount defines a fixed amount for:

*   **The whole cart** – the discount value is calculated during the validation as a difference between the total amount of the customer's order and the new price.
*   **Particular products** – the discount is applied to item subtotal. The total discount amount is calculated during the validation and it is a difference between the initial item price and the new item price

### Free products

Free products enable you to offer items from your inventory for free. First, you need to decide on the discount effect. 

Then, you need to decide which product you want to add for free and in what quantity. 

Please note that this type of discount is based on the products added to the Products section in your dashboard. If you haven't synced your inventory yet, please follow the [Products and Product Collections](https://support.voucherify.io/article/52-product-manager) guide first. 

### Free shipping

You can also offer your customers free shipping. The discount is based on the Free products: Add missing order items to match the total discount units count discount type, and it cannot be edited.

### Dynamic discount values

For percent, amount, new price, and free products, you can set a fixed discount value or use a formula builder to create a dynamic discount expression. Formulas with mathematical and logical operators assign a dynamic discount value. Discount value will be calculated during redemption based on the provided formula and metadata values. Read more in the [Dynamic discount value formula builder](https://support.voucherify.io/article/568-how-to-create-dynamic-discount-value) section.

## Order discount effects

These discounts are applied to the whole cart, which means the sum of all products in the order (total order amount). Three discount types can be applied:

*   [Amount](#amount-discount)
*   [Percent](#percent-discount)
*   [New price](#new-price)

## Product discount effects

Product discounts determine how discounts are, or are not, applied to individual [products or collections](/prepare/products). You can also choose [discounted products and their effects](#choosing-discounted-products) and, in some cases, [additional caps or limitations](#discounted-product-limits-–-capped-by).

These product limits are applied as [validation rules](#validation-rules-and-product-discounts), which can be reused in the future. In the Conditions step, Use the Configured Options Only option to use only the product limits. To add more validation rules, click With Rules to search for an existing validation rule or create a new one with the plus button. If you are going to reuse an existing rule, Voucherify will clone the rule, so its original configuration will not be overwritten.

Check this sample order below. It will be used in the examples of different effects below:

</Accordion>

#### How to calculate the discount per item?

This effect splits the discount proportionally among the discounted products per line item. Each product is counted as an individual line item, whether there is one or multiple units of the product. In the example above:

- The order contains 4 order lines: mug, poster, t-shirt, and thermal bottle.

- The mug, poster, and t-shirt are discounted.

- The discount applied to the mug (\$1.6):
  - *10 discount value* × (*20 total amount for the mugs* / (*20 total amount for the mugs* + *45 total amount for the posters* + *60 total amount for the t-shirts*)).

- The discount applied to the posters (\$3.6):
  - *10 discount value* × (*45 total amount for the posters* / (*20 total amount for the mug* + *45 total amount for the poster* + *60 total amount for the t-shirts*)).

- The discount applied to the t-shirts (\$4.8):
  - *10 discount value* × (*60 total amount for the t-shirts* / (*20 total amount for the mugs* + *45 total amount for the posters* + *60 total amount for the t-shirts*)).

### Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to quantity

This effect splits and applies the discount to the chosen items proportionally to their share in the total discounted items quantity per line item. Each product unit will be counted as an individual line item. In the case of multiple product units in the line item, the quantity will be higher, and therefore, the proportional discount by quantity will also be higher.

Unroll a sample order with a \$10 discount coupon applicable to Adventure-branded items:

<Accordion title="Sample order with Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to quantity">

|Product                      |Unit price |Quantity|Price and discount |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
|Adventure Mug                |\$10        |2       |\$20  -\$2.5         |
|Adventure Poster             |\$15        |3       |\$45  -\$3.75        |
|Adventure T-shirt            |\$20        |3       |\$60  -\$3.75        |
|Star Thermal Bottle          |\$25        |2       |\$50  -\$0           |
|Order amount before discounts|           |        |\$175               |

</Accordion>

#### How to calculate the discount per item?

This effect splits the discount proportionally among the discounted product units per line item. Each product will be counted as an individual line item, whether there is one or multiple units of the product. In the example above:

- The order contains 4 order lines: mug, poster, beanie, and thermal bottle.

- The mugs, posters, and t-shirts are discounted.

- The discount applied to the mugs (\$2.5):
  -\$10 discount value × (2 as the total quantity of mugs / (2 as the total quantity of mugs + 3 as the total quantity of posters + 3 as the total quantity of t-shirts)).

- The discount applied to the posters (\$3.75):
  -\$10 discount value × (3 as the total quantity of posters / (2 as the total quantity of mugs + 3 as the total quantity of posters + 3 as the total quantity of t-shirts)).

- The discount applied to the t-shirts (\$3.75):
  -\$10 discount value × (3 as the total quantity of t-shirts / (2 as the total quantity of mugs + 3 as the total quantity of posters + 3 as the total quantity of t-shirts)).

### Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal

This effect applies the discount to the product order lines.

This effect can be combined with additional discount limits – **Maximum discount amount** and **Maximum amount combined for all order lines**. For selected products or collections, you can further define additional cap limits.

Unroll a sample order with a 10% discount coupon applicable to Adventure-branded items:  

<Accordion title="Sample order with Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal">

|Product                      |Unit price |Quantity|Price and discount |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------|-------------------|

</Accordion>

### New price discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal

This effect applies a new price to products or product collections.

Define which products or collections will have new prices when redeeming the discount. The total discount amount is calculated during the validation, and it is a difference between the initial item price and the item price set in the discount settings.

This effect can be combined with additional discount limits – **Max units per order item** and **Max units combined for all matched order lines**.

Unroll a sample order with a new price set to \$10 applicable to Adventure-branded items:

<Accordion title="Sample order with New price discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal">

</Accordion>

### Choosing discounted products

In the product discounts, you can choose the products covered by the discounts:

*   Each product – apply the discount to all products, except for the products or collections added in the excluded products section.
*   Selected products – add products or collections that are covered by the discount, except for the products or collections added in the excluded products section.
*   Excluded products – add products or collections that are NOT covered by the discount. The discount will not be applied to the selected items even if the item is included in a discounted collection.

You can further define how discounts are applied and limited with:

*   [Application rules](#application-rules)
*   [Caps](#discounted-product-limits-–-capped-by)
*   [Conditions (validation rules)](#validation-rules-and-product-discounts)

The defined selected and excluded products are included in validation rules which can be reused in the future.

<Note>
<Badge color="blue">Product SKUs</Badge>

If the chosen product has SKUs defined, the new price will be set for the product and all product SKUs that are passed in a redemption request.
</Note>

## Reward effects

<Info>
<Badge color="gray">Prerequisite</Badge>

This type of discount is based on the items added to the Products section in the Voucherify Dashboard. If you have not uploaded your inventory yet, follow the [Products and Product Collections](/prepare/products) guide first.
</Info>

The reward category adds a defined quantity of free items from the product inventory to the customer’s cart for free.

### Add missing order items to match total discount units count

This effect adds items to the cart only if a customer has fewer free items than offered by the code (the number of the items in the cart is lower than the unit value).

For example, the code gives two free t-shirts:

*   If the customer does not have the t-shirt in the cart, then free t-shirts will be added to the order and they will be discounted full-price.
*   If the customer has one t-shirt in the cart, then one t-shirt will be added to the order and both t-shirts will be discounted full-price.
*   If a customer already has two t-shirts in their cart, then the number of t-shirts already matches the unit value. After applying the code, no extra t-shirts will be added but both t-shirts will be discounted full-price.

### Always add new units items

This effect adds items to the cart in the number defined by the unit quantity.

For example, the code adds two free t-shirts:

*   If the customer does not have the t-shirt in the cart, then two t-shirts will be added to the order and they will be discounted full-price.
*   If the customer has any number of t-shirts in the cart, then two t-shirts will be added to the order but only those two t-shirts will be discounted full-price.

### Add many order items

This effect adds multiple items to the cart, each with a custom effect: either [Add missing order items to match total discount units count](#add-missing-order-items-to-match-total-discount-units-count) or [Always add new units items](#always-add-new-units-items).

### Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items

This effect replaces one order item or an order item from a selected collection with another order item in the defined quantity per replaced unit.

For example, the code can replace a medium-sized coffee with a large coffee.

You can further define [additional cap limits](#discounted-product-limits-–-capped-by):

*   **Max units per order item** – the minimum value must be 1.
*   **Max units combined for all matched order lines** – the minimum value must be 1.

You can also add [Application Rules](#application-rules).

Unroll a sample order with a replaced one Adventure T-shirt (cheaper product) with one Adventure T-shirt, Limited Edition (more expensive product):

<Accordion title="Sample order with Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items 1">

| Product                         | Unit price | Quantity | Price and discount |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Adventure T-shirt                | \$20      | 3 items in the cart<br />−1 replaced item<br />–<br />2 total quantity | \$60<br />-\$20<br />–<br />\$40 |
| Adventure T-shirt, Limited Edition | \$25      | 0 items in the cart<br />+1 bonus item<br />–<br />1 total quantity | \$0<br />+\$25<br />–<br />\$25 -\$20 = \$5 discount amount<br />\$20 |
| **Order amount before discounts** |            |          | **\$60** |
| **Total discount**               |            |          | **\$5 bonus** |
| **Total amount**                 |            |          | **\$60** |

</Accordion>

The discount is calculated as the difference between the amount of the added order items and the amount of the replaced order items. This makes the discount shown as a bonus while the total amount stays the same.

Unroll a sample order with a replaced one Star Thermal Bottle (more expensive product) with one Adventure Mug (cheaper product):

<Accordion title="Sample order with Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items 2">

| Product             | Unit price | Quantity | Price and discount |
| ------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| Star Thermal Bottle | \$25      | 3 items in the cart<br />−1 replaced item<br />–<br />2 total quantity | \$75<br />-\$25<br />–<br />\$50 |
| Adventure Mug       | \$10      | 0 items in the cart<br />+1 bonus item<br />–<br />1 total quantity | \$0<br />+\$10<br />–<br />\$10 |
| **Order amount before discounts** |            |          | **\$75** |
| **Total discount**               |            |          | **\$0** |
| **Total amount**                 |            |          | **\$60** |

</Accordion>

Because the price of the Adventure Mug is lower than the price of the Star Thermal Bottle, no discount is calculated. However, the total amount is lower than the order amount before discounts, because the price of the replacement item – Adventure Mug – is lower than the price of the replaced item – Star Thermal Bottle.

Unroll a sample order with a replaced one Star Thermal Bottle (more expensive product) with three Adventure Mugs (cheaper products whose price in total is higher than the price of the replaced item):

<Accordion title="Sample order with Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items 3">

| Product             | Unit price | Quantity | Price and discount |

</Accordion>

The discount is calculated as the difference between the amount of the added order items (three items with a price of 30 in total) and the amount of the replaced order items (one item with a price of 25). This makes the discount shown as a bonus while the total amount stays the same.

## Free shipping

This discount category adds a free shipping discount. Shipping is added as a built-in item in the [Products](about://support.voucherify.io/article/16-dashboard-sections#products) section in the dashboard.

## Bundle

Bundles let you combine multiple products into a single discount offer. You can define how discounts apply to the products in the bundle or to the entire order.

You can add a bundle discount when configuring the Discount value step in a campaign or promotion.

Click **+ Add discount** > **Bundles**, and choose one of the available bundle types.

<Note>
**Read the [detailed guide](/build/product-bundles) about bundles in Voucherify.**
</Note>

### General Rules

*   Bundles can be created only within Discount Campaigns, Referrals, or Promotions.
*   Bundles can be edited within a campaign or promotion tier.
*   The bundle configuration dialog includes three steps:
    *   Bundled items: Set up the bundle products or product collections and the minimum quantity of products that must be in a customer’s cart.
    *   Discount: Set up Maximum number of eligible bundles (this determines how discounts are multiplied if there are many bundles in a customer’s cart) and other discount details, including [dynamic formula](https://support.voucherify.io/article/568-how-to-create-dynamic-discount-value).
    *   Conditions: Optionally set up a validation rule.
*   Once you add a bundle discount of a given type, you cannot add another. Delete the existing one to add a new discount.

### Bundle types

The following bundle types are available:
- **Buy X, Get Y for Free (Free products)**
- **Discount Whole Order (Order discount)**
- **Discount Bundle Items by Fixed Amount (Amount product discount)**
- **Discount Percentage Off Bundle Items (Percentage product discount)**
- **Set Price for Bundle Items (New unit price discount)**
- **Split Discount Between Bundle Items (Split product discount)**

## Discount value and additional limits

The discount value field specifies the amount or the percent of the discount. The discount value can be static or dynamic.

Static discounts are applied without any additional conditions. Discounts are static by default.

[Dynamic formulas](https://support.voucherify.io/article/568-how-to-create-dynamic-discount-value) change the discount value based on defined conditions. All discount values (except for the shipping discount) can be dynamic. Click **Build formula** to open the dynamic discount formula builder.

### Additional discount limits

Some discount categories, types, and effects have additional discount limits:

*   **Maximum discount amount** – in percent discounts, it sets the maximum amount of the applied discount for the whole order (order discounts) or a given order line (product discounts).
*   **Maximum amount combined for all order lines** – in product discounts, it sets the maximum amount of the applied discount to the whole order. This limit is available for:
    *   [Amount discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal](#amount-discount%3A-apply-the-discount-to-item-subtotal)
    *   [Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit](#amount-discount:-apply-the-full-discount-to-each-item-unit)
    *   [Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal](#percent-discount%3A-apply-the-discount-to-item-subtotal)
*   [Discount limits for selected products – caps](#discounted-product-limits-–-capped-by):
    *   **Maximum discount amount per order line**
    *   **Maximum discount amount per order**
    *   **Max units per order item**
    *   **Max units combined for all matched order lines**

#### Discounted product limits – Capped by

The following discount types can be further modified with additional caps to secure the campaign budget:

*   [Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit](#amount-discount%3A-apply-the-full-discount-to-each-item-unit)
*   [Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal](#percent-discount%3A-apply-the-discount-to-item-subtotal)
*   [New price: Apply the discount to item subtotal](#new-price-discount%3A-apply-the-discount-to-item-subtotal)

The limits listed here also work together with [additional discount limits](#additional-discount-limits): Maximum discount amount per order line and Maximum discount amount per order. The discount is always calculated in such a way as to apply the lowest possible discount, whether from the product limit caps, or other limits.

### Maximum discount amount per order line

This limits the amount of the discount for one order line or item subtotal.

<Accordion title="Maximum discount amount per order line – example">

If set to \$25: The customer orders five discounted product units in three order lines. A maximum of \$25 discount will be applied to each applicable order line.
</Accordion>

#### Maximum discount amount per order

This limits the discount amount for the whole cart.

<Accordion title="Maximum discount amount per order - example">
If set to \$100: The customer orders five discounted product units in three order lines. The maximum discount for all order lines will reach \$100.
</Accordion>

#### Maximum units per order item

This limits the number of item units that can be discounted in one order line or item subtotal.

<Accordion title="Maximum units per order item – example">

If set to 3: The customer orders five units of a discounted product. However, only three units will be discounted.

</Accordion>

#### Maximum units combined for all matched order lines

This limits the number of item units covered by the discount across all matching order lines or item subtotals.

<Accordion title="Maximum units combined for all matched order lines – example">

If set to 5: The customer orders two product units in one order line, and four product units in another order line, making six product units in total. The discount applies to all order lines. Only five units are discounted and the remaining unit has a full price.

</Accordion>

#### Maximum units per campaign

<Info>
This and the following limits are available on demand. Contact [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support) to enable them for your organization.
</Info>

This limits the number of discounted item units (product, SKU, collection) that all customers can receive in a given campaign.

If a product is selected, the limit covers all discounts across all SKUs belonging to that product. If a product collection is selected, the limit covers all products/SKUs within the collection. It's recommended to use this limit with **Maximum units per customer in campaign**, so one customer doesn’t use up all discounted items. The limit can be combined with a dynamic formula.

<Accordion title="Maximum units per campaign – example">

If set to 10, it applies to all customers:

*   Customer Alex buys 5 item units and receives a discount on 5 units
*   Then, customer Bobby buys 4 item units and receives a discount on 4 units
*   Then, customer Clarence buys 3 item units, but receives a discount only on 1 unit, as the limit is reached in this order. 2 item units are not discounted.

</Accordion>

#### Maximum units per customer in campaign

This limits the number of discounted item units (product, SKU, collection) that one customer can receive in a given campaign.

<Tip>

It's recommended to use this limit with **Maximum units per campaign**, so that many customers will not exceed the total number of item units available for discount. The limit can be combined with a dynamic formula.

</Tip>

<Accordion title="Maximum units per customer in campaign – example">

If set to 5: The customer can buy a maximum of 5 item units with a discount. If they buy a 6th item or more, these items will not be discounted. This limit can be split between orders, so if the customer buys 3 item units in one order, and 3 item units in the second order, 5 item units will be discounted and 1 item unit from the second order will have its full price.

</Accordion>

#### Maximum units per campaign for a product in a collection

This limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that all customers can receive in a given campaign.

<Tip>

It is recommended to combine this limit with **Maximum units per customer for a product in a collection**, so one customer doesn’t use up all discounted items. The limit can be combined with a dynamic formula.

</Tip>

<Accordion title="Maximum units per campaign for a product in a collection – example">

If set to 5 for an *Adventure brand* collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters, a maximum of 5 Adventure T-shirts, 5 Adventure beanies, and 5 Adventure posters will be discounted. The limit isn't split between all products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units. The limit of 5 item units is for all customers:

*   Customer Alex buys 5 Adventure T-shirts (limit reached), 1 Adventure beanie, and 4 Adventure posters and receives a discount on all item units
*   Then, customer Bobby buys 3 Adventure T-shirts, 3 Adventure beanies, and 2 Adventure posters. Bobby will not receive a discount on Adventure T-shirts (limit reached by Alex), 3 Adventure beanies (limit not reached yet), and 1 Adventure poster (limit reached).
*   Then, customer Clarence buys 1 Adventure T-shirt, 3 Adventure beanies, and 3 Adventure posters.

#### Maximum units per promotion tier

This limits the number of discounted item units that all customers can receive in a promotion tier.

## Application rules

With the application rules, you can set the discount effect for the cheapest, most expensive, or all products or product units. Additionally, you can configure the target of the discount, when the discount will be applied (e.g. for every other order line), or if some of the discounts will be skipped.

The application rules can be set for:

*   [All product discounts](#product-discount-effects),
*   [Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items](#upgrade-bonus%3A-replace-order-items) in the Rewards discount effects,
*   Items covered by a gift card in a [gift card campaign](/build/create-gift-cards).

### Effects

The application rules have the following effects:
*   **For every** – the discount will be applied to every resource as defined in the target, application, and skip settings. The discounts are applied as determined by order set in the request.
*   **For the cheapest** – the discount will be applied only to the cheapest resource.
*   **Starting from the cheapest** – the discount will be applied to the cheapest resource and to any other resources as defined in the target, application, and skip settings.
*   **For the most expensive** – the discount will be applied only to the most expensive resource.
*   **Starting from the most expensive** – the discount will be applied to the cheapest resource and to any other resources as defined in the target, application, and skip settings.

### Target

The application rules can target the following:
*   **Order line** – The discount will be applied to whole order lines, i.e. products or SKUs sent in the order, but not to the units. For example, if a customer orders 3 Adventure Mugs for \$10 each and 2 Adventure T-shirts for \$20 each, the discount will be applied to the total amount of \$30 and the total amount of \$20, not to mug or T-shirt units.
*   **Unit** – The discount will be applied to units within order lines. For example, if a customer orders 3 Adventure Mugs for \$10 each and 2 Adventure t-shirts for \$20 each, the discount will be calculated on the basis of the ordered mug and t-shirt units. In combination with the every and skip rules as well as amount, proportional, and percentage discounts, the discounts are calculated and applied to applicable units.

### Apply the discount to

The application rules can apply the discount as follows:
*   **All** – the discount will be applied to all resources.
*   **Every** – the discount will be applied to a number of resources as determined in the Repeat field. For example, Repeat 3 means that every third resource will be covered by the discount.

### Skipping

The application rules can skip items as follows:
*   **None** – the discount will be applied to the first resource and then to any other resource as defined in the Apply discount to setting.
*   **First** – the discount will not be applied to a number of items defined in the Skip field. For example, Skip 3 means that the discount will be applied to the fourth resource.

The application rules can be combined with [the Capped by settings](#discounted-product-limits-–-capped-by) to limit the maximum discount amount or the number of resources covered by the discount.

### Application rules - examples

Check the following examples to see how application rules can be used.

## Conditions and validation rules

Optionally, discounts can have conditions defined with [validation rules](/personalize/validation-rules-reference), which limit discount application. The validation rules must be met for the discount to be applied.

Use the search field to find and reuse existing validation rules.

To create a new rule, click the plus button to open the [validation rule builder](https://support.voucherify.io/article/148-how-to-build-a-rule) in the Campaign Manager. You can also create validation rules in the [Validation Rules](https://support.voucherify.io/article/16-dashboard-sections#valrules) section in the dashboard for future use.

### Validation rules and product discounts

For product discounts, Voucherify creates a validation rule that includes all discounted products. If you want to include the products only, in the **Conditions** step, check **Configured options** only. If you want to add further conditions, click With rules and the plus button. If you want to reuse an existing validation rule, select the rule from the search field. 

The new or cloned rule is assigned to the campaign but you will not be able to remove it in the campaign manager nor in the campaign details. However, you can freely edit the rule to add new or remove old conditions.

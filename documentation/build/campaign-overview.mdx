Voucherify is an incentive optimization engine for digital teams. The Build section covers everything you need to configure campaigns—from discount mechanics to loyalty tiers.

## Why this matters

Every setting you configure—incentive type, validation rules, budget caps—maps directly to how Voucherify processes campaign data and delivers customer experiences. Understanding these building blocks lets you:

- **Launch fast** – Go from idea to live campaign without engineering bottlenecks
- **Experiment at scale** – Test variations across channels and segments
- **Optimize ROI** – Drop underperformers, double down on what works

## What you'll configure

The Build section walks you through the core campaign types:

| Campaign type | Use case |
|---------------|----------|
| [Discount coupons](/build/discount-promotion-overview) | Unique or bulk codes customers enter at checkout |
| [Cart promotions](/build/create-discount-promotions) | Automatic discounts based on cart contents |
| [Loyalty programs](/build/loyalty-campaign-overview) | Points, tiers, and rewards for repeat customers |
| [Gift cards](/build/gift-card-overview) | Prepaid balances customers can spend |
| [Referral programs](/build/referral-campaign-overview) | Advocate-driven acquisition with tracked rewards |

## How campaigns connect

Campaigns don't exist in isolation. They share validation rules, customer segments, and product catalogs. This composable architecture means you can:

- Reuse rules across campaign types
- Stack incentives for complex promotions
- Orchestrate omnichannel experiences from a single source of truth

<Tip>
Start with one campaign type, then layer in complexity as you learn what resonates with your customers.

Discount campaigns allow customers to receive financial benefits, such as percentage discounts, fixed amounts off, or free shipping. 

Voucherify manages these incentives through two primary mechanisms: **Discount coupons**, which require a code, and **Cart promotions**, which apply automatically based on cart contents.

Learn how discount campaigns work—from generating unique bulk codes to setting up automatic, tier-based promotions.

## Key discount concepts

The following concepts are key for understanding the discount engine.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discount coupon">
    A code that a customer must enter to receive a benefit. Coupons are best used when you want to track individual customer actions or limit the discount to a specific audience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cart promotion">
    A discount applied automatically when a customer's cart meets specific criteria. No code is required from the customer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generic code">
    A single, standalone code (for example, `SUMMER20`) shared by multiple customers. Everyone uses the same phrase to redeem the discount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bulk codes">
    A set of unique, random codes (for example, `s9-RaNd0m`) generated in a batch. Each code is unique to a specific customer or interaction, allowing for precise tracking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validation rules">
    The conditions that must be met for a discount to be valid. These can include order volume, customer segments, specific products, or time frames.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Promotion tiers">
    Levels of benefits within a single cart promotion campaign. For example, you can set up a rule where spending $50 grants 5% off, while spending $100 grants 10% off.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Redemption">
    The successful application of a discount to an order. This process records the usage in the dashboard and updates the campaign budget or code usage limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Distribution">
    The mechanism for delivering coupon codes to end customers via email, SMS, or web widgets. This is required for coupon campaigns but skipped for cart promotions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Publication">
    Assigning a discount coupon to a given customer.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Discount workflow

Voucherify supports every step of the discount campaign lifecycle.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Build your campaign mechanics, define **Validation rules**, and set the discount value in the **Dashboard**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Distribution (coupons only)">
    Assign (publish) coupon codes to customers. You can send them directly or expose them via your frontend. **Cart promotions** are active immediately and don't require distribution.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validation and Redemption">
    When a customer enters a code or updates their cart, Voucherify validates the request against your rules. If valid, the discount is applied (redeemed) to the order total. Depending on your settings, a coupon will be used up here.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analysis">
    Track the performance of your discount campaigns using real-time reports to understand which codes or rules drive the most sales.

A bundle is a group of products, services, or features offered together as a single package. Bundles are often priced lower than the total cost of purchasing each item separately. In Voucherify, bundles work with cart promotions, generic codes, and unique codes.

This article describes in detail how bundles work, including bundle multiplication that multiplies discounts and limits based on the number of bundles in the cart.

## Glossary

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bundle">
    A bundle is a group of products, services, or features offered together as a single package. Bundles are often priced lower than the total cost of purchasing each item separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bundled items">
    Bundled items are the individual products or services that make up a bundle. When a customer buys all required bundled items together, they become eligible for the bundle discount or reward.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimum quantity of products">
    The minimum quantity of products defines how many items must be included in the bundle for it to qualify for the promotion. If the customer adds fewer items than the minimum, the bundle discount doesn’t apply.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maximum number of eligible bundles">
    The maximum number of eligible bundles sets a cap on how many bundles can be counted in a single order. This limit controls how many times the bundle discount can apply per transaction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Item discount limit">
    We recommend setting an item discount limit in:

    * **Amount discount**: Apply the full discount to each item unit
    * **New price**: Apply the discount to item unit
    * **Upgrade Bonus**: Replace order items

    Without the limit, each eligible unit receives the discount, regardless of how many bundles are in the order. By default, Voucherify automatically assigns the item discount limit for the discounted items to 1.

<Accordion title="Free products: Add missing order items to match total discount units count – example">

**Example:**

Buy 1 laptop → get 1 laptop bag free.

Buy 2 laptops → get 2 laptop bags free to reach the required total.

</Accordion>

### Free products: Always add new units items

**Free products: Always add new units items** always adds new free products. It ignores whether the same product already exists in the cart.

<Accordion title="Free products: Always add new units items – example">

**Example:**

</Accordion>

### Free products: Add many order items

**Free products: Add many order items** adds multiple free products at once when several bundles are qualified.

<Accordion title="Free products: Add many order items – example">

**Example:**

Buy 2 pizzas + 2 colas → get 4 free desserts.

**Result**:

All free products are multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

### Upgrade bonus: Replace order items

**Upgrade bonus: Replace order items** replaces existing products with upgraded ones. The multiplication applies to both the added and removed items.

<Accordion title="Upgrade bonus: Replace order items – example">

**Example:**

Buy 3 small coffees → upgrade to 3 large coffees.

**Result**:

</Accordion>

## Discount whole order

The **Discount whole order** discount category has the following types.

### Amount discount: Apply to whole cart

**Amount discount: Apply to whole cart** applies a fixed amount discount to the entire cart. The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Amount Discount: Apply to whole cart – example">

**Example:**

$1 discount per bundle (lip balm + hand cream) 

5 × lip balms + hand creams → $5 off the whole cart.

**Result**:

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and applies to the cart total.

</Accordion>

### Percent discount: Apply to whole cart

**Percent discount: Apply to whole cart** applies a percent discount to the entire cart. The percentage value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

5 × cleaning sprays + microfiber cloths → 25% off the whole cart.

**Result**:

</Accordion>

### New price: Apply to whole cart

<Accordion title="New price: Apply to whole cart – example">

**Example:**

New total cart price: $50 per bundle (phone case + screen protector) 

5x phone cases + screen protectors → $50 total, not multiplied.

</Accordion>

## Discount bundle items by fixed amount

The **Discount bundle items by fixed amount** discount category has the following types.

### Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit

**Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit** applies a full discount to each item unit. The number of discounted units is multiplied by the number of bundles. By default, Voucherify automatically assigns the **Maximum eligible units per order item** limit to 1. Without a limit, each eligible unit receives the discount, regardless of how many bundles are in the order.

<Accordion title="Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit – example">

**Example**:

Laptop + bag, get $20 off for a single mouse

<Badge color="blue">Cart 1: Limit set</Badge>

**Bundle**: Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** **Maximum eligible units per order item** limit set to **1**

**Cart contents**:

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 3 – $40 total

**Explanation**:

The cart contains two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2). Each bundle qualifies for one discounted mouse because the discount limit is set to one per bundle. Only two mice receive the discount, giving the customer a total discount of 2 × $20 = $40. The third mouse remains at full price.

<Badge color="blue">Cart 2 – No Limit Set</Badge>

**Bundle**: Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** No maximum eligible units per order item limit set

**Cart contents**:

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 3 – $60 total

**Explanation**:

The cart again includes two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2). Because there is no limit on the number of discounted items, all three mice receive the discount, so it’s $60 in total. The rule applies to every matching product in the cart, not just one per bundle.

**Result**:

The discount value remains the same per unit item. The number of max discounted units is multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

### Amount discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal

**Amount discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal** applies a fixed discount to the subtotal of each targeted product. The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Warning>
If a customer splits identical items into separate order lines, the discount applies individually to each line. This results in a higher total discount than if the items were grouped.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Amount discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal – example">

**Example**:

Bundle: Laptop + bag, get $20 off for a mouse collection product

<Badge color="blue">Cart 1: Combined mouse order line</Badge>

**Bundle**: Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** $20 for each bundle

**Cart contents**:

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 3  (one order line) $40 discount

**Explanation**:

The cart includes two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2), making the customer eligible for a $40 subtotal discount. Because all three mice are grouped in a single order line, the discount is applied once to that line’s subtotal. 

<Badge color="blue">Cart 2: Split mouse order lines</Badge>

**Bundle**: Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** Subtotal discount applies separately to each order line

**Cart contents**:

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 1  $40 discount

Mouse × 1  $40 discount

Mouse × 1  (three separate order lines) $40 discount

**Explanation**:

The cart again includes two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2). Because each mouse is on a separate order line, the discount is applied individually to each line. Each mouse line receives a \$40 discount, resulting in a total of $120 off.

**Result**:

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and applied to the subtotal of each targeted item.

</Accordion>

## Discount percentage off bundle items

The **Discount percentage off bundle items** discount category has the following types.

### Percent discounts (item level)

**Percent discounts (item level)** applies a percentage discount to targeted items. The discount percent is multiplied by the number of bundles.

**Example:**

5% per bundle (2 packs of crisps) 

4x packs of crisps → 10% off all soda drinks in the targeted collection.

**Result**:

</Accordion>

## Set price for bundle items

The **Set price for bundle items** discount category has the following types.

### New price: Apply the discount to item unit

**New price: Apply the discount to item unit** sets a new price for selected items. The value does not multiply, but the number of affected items multiplies by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="New price: Apply the discount to item unit – example">

**Example**:

Set price: \$10 per ticket, $2 per drink 

**Maximum eligible units per order item** limit set to: 1 ticket and 2 drinks per bundle.

2 bundles = up to 2 tickets at \$10 and 4 drinks at $2 discounted.

The **Split discount between bundle items** discount category has the following types.

### Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to amount

**Example**:

**Bundle**: Coffee Machine + Grinder

**Discounted products**: Coffee Beans + Filter Pack

**Cart contents**:

Coffee Machine × 2  

Grinder × 2  

Coffee Beans – $30 (60% of the discounted amount)  

Filter Pack – $20 (40% of the discounted amount)

**Explanation**:

The discount is \$10 per bundle. With two bundles, the customer gets \$20 off in total. The discount is split proportionally — Coffee Beans receive \$12 (60%) and the Filter Pack receives \$8 (40%).

The allocation is based on the subtotal of all targeted order line items, not just the items within a single bundle.

**Result**:

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and split proportionally across the targeted order line items based on their subtotal value.

## Overview

Do you need to share gift cards from other sources with Voucherify? You can handle this scenario using the **CSV Import Tool** in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import gift cards, which you can group as a campaign or manage as standalone items.

<Info>

You can also use this import feature to update existing gift cards in your campaigns.

* The start and expiration dates in the CSV file should be provided in compliance with the **ISO 8601** norms, for example, `2020-03-11T09:00:00.000Z`.
* CSV columns mapped to Custom Attributes will be added as gift cards' metadata. The number of custom attributes you can import as metadata is unlimited.
* You cannot import two identical codes to a single Project.
* When importing existing incentives (discount coupons, referral codes, loyalty cards, or gift cards) into a campaign, only two fields can be updated: the **active** status (`true/false`) and the **category**. All other attributes remain unchanged.

</Note>

## Import gift cards

You can import gift cards by first importing them as generic cards or by grouping them into a campaign.

* **Generic codes** function as independent gift cards.
* **Campaign codes** are assigned to a particular campaign and inherit its settings (validation rules, timeframe, redemption limits).

### Webhook triggers

Webhooks can be triggered when you import gift cards from the main campaign list (the **Campaigns** tab) and are sent for each created or updated gift card. They are **not** triggered when you import gift cards into a specific campaign's view.

To enable webhooks when uploading gift cards from the **Campaigns** tab, check the box labeled **Create a webhook sendout for the vouchers created and updated during the import** in step 2 of the import process (**Map Fields**).

### Metadata (custom attributes) mapping

To add a field that is unlisted in the built-in properties, change the **Voucherify fields** dropdown to **Metadata (Schema)** or **Metadata (Unknown)** during the mapping step. 

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Understanding metadata overrides">

When a gift card already has a custom attribute, it can be modified, or you can add a new attribute via the import metadata mapping field.

If you want the gift cards to have different attributes than those in the campaign, you must specify them in the appropriate mapping fields in the import file. Otherwise, the campaign's default settings will be applied.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Generic gift card import (standalone)

To import generic gift cards, prepare a CSV file with your codes. These codes will function as standalone gift cards, independent of a campaign.

Besides **the gift card code**, your file must include the following gift card attributes:

* **Voucher Type** (text: `GIFT_VOUCHER`)
* **Balance** (an integer value - number representing the initial balance)
* **Code** (the unique gift card code)

The following fields in the CSV template are optional:

* Category
* Active (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
* Start date
* Expiration date
* Redeemed quantity
* Redemption limit
* Additional Info
* Formula

<Info>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

## Import gift cards to a campaign

If you do not have a campaign for your codes, you must create a gift card campaign first.

When adding gift cards to an existing campaign, the CSV may contain:

* **Required:**
    * `Code`
* **Optional:**
    * `Active`
    * `Category`
    * `Redeemed Quantity`
    * Custom metadata fields

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings.

### Inheritance and metadata behavior

* If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted from the CSV $\rightarrow$ imported gift cards become `TRUE`.
* If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted from the CSV $\rightarrow$ imported gift cards become `FALSE`.

### Metadata behavior

* If metadata is omitted $\rightarrow$ the gift card inherits the campaign's metadata.
* If metadata columns are added $\rightarrow$ the mapped metadata only overrides those specific fields.

<Info>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

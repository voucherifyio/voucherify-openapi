If you need to share codes from other sources with Voucherify, you can handle this scenario using the Import CSV tool in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import:
- Generic gift cards.
- New unique gift cards to a campaign.
- Existing gift cards to update them.

## Preparing CSV file for generic gift cards

Use these fields when importing **standalone (generic) gift cards**. Generic gift cards are not assigned to a campaign and work independently.

### Required fields

- **Voucher Type**  
  Defines the voucher type.  
  For gift cards, the value must be `GIFT_VOUCHER`.

- **Code**  
  A unique gift card code.  
  You cannot import two identical codes into a single Voucherify project.

- **Balance**  
  The initial gift card balance.  
  Must be provided as an integer value (for example, `100`).

### Optional fields

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the gift card.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.  
  An inactive gift card cannot be redeemed, even if it is within its validity timeframe.

- **Start date**  
  The date when the gift card becomes valid.  
  Must follow the ISO 8601 format, for example:  
  `2022-09-19T00:00:00.000Z`.

- **Expiration date**  
  The date when the gift card expires.  
  Must follow the ISO 8601 format, for example:  
  `2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z`.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the gift card.  
  Categories help you filter and organize codes in the Dashboard.

- **Redemption limit**  
  The maximum number of times the gift card can be redeemed.  
  If omitted, the redemption limit is set to unlimited.

- **Redeemed quantity**  
  The number of times the gift card has already been redeemed.  
  If omitted, the value defaults to `0`.

- **Redeemed amount**  
  The amount already redeemed from the available gift card balance.

- **Additional Info**  
  Any additional information you want to store with the gift card.  
  This field is informational only.

- **Formula**  
  A dynamic formula applied to the gift card.  
  Provide the *Expression Output* of an existing formula.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**  
  Any additional columns mapped as metadata are stored as gift card metadata.  
  Metadata fields can be schema-defined or schema-less, and their number is unlimited.

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

These codes will function as standalone gift cards, independent of a campaign. 

### Import generic gift cards

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** and **Import CSV**.

## Preparing CSV file for campaign gift cards

<Info>

<Badge color="gray">Import gift cards to campaign prerequisite</Badge>

If you don't have a campaign for your codes yet, [create a gift card campaign](/build/create-gift-cards) first.

</Info>

Use these fields when importing gift cards **into an existing gift card campaign**.  
Imported gift cards inherit all campaign settings unless explicitly overridden.

### Required fields

- **Code**  
  A unique gift card code.

### Optional fields

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the gift card.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

  Import behavior:
  - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted, imported gift cards are set to `TRUE`.
  - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted, imported gift cards are set to `FALSE`.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the gift card for filtering and organization.

- **Balance**  
  The initial gift card balance.  
  If omitted, the campaign default balance is applied.

- **Redeemed quantity**  
  The number of times the gift card has already been redeemed.

- **Redeemed amount**  
  The amount already redeemed from the available gift card balance.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**  
  Additional data stored as gift card metadata.

  Metadata import behavior:
  - If metadata columns are omitted, the gift card inherits the campaign's metadata.
  - If metadata columns are added and mapped, only those specific fields are overridden.
  - Metadata that is not mapped remains unchanged.

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

<a href="/examples/import-gift-cards-into-campaign-template.csv" download>CSV gift card file template</a>

</Note>

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings as well as validation rules, time frame, redemption limits, and so on.

### Import behavior for selected attributes

Some of the attributes work as follows when imported:
- **Active**:
    - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `TRUE`.
    - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `FALSE`.
- **Metadata**:
    - If metadata is omitted, the voucher inherits the campaign's metadata.
    - If metadata columns are added, the mapped metadata only overrides those specific fields.

### Import gift cards to a campaign

In **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**, go to the gift card campaign where you want to import the cards. In the top right corner, use the three-dot menu to **Import CSV file**.

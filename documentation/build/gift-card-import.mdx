If you need to share codes from other sources with Voucherify, you can handle this scenario using the Import CSV tool in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import:
- Generic gift cards.
- New unique gift cards to a campaign.
- Existing gift cards to update them.

## Preparing CSV file for generic gift cards

To import generic gift cards, prepare a CSV file with your codes and define columns as follows:
- Required:
    - **Voucher Type** (text: `GIFT_VOUCHER`)
    - **Balance** (an integer value - number representing the initial balance)
    - **Code** (the unique gift card code)
- Optional:
    - Category
    - Active (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
    - Start date
    - Expiration date
    - Redeemed quantity
    - Redemption limit
    - Additional Info
    - Formula

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

</Note>

These codes will function as standalone gift cards, independent of a campaign. 

### Import generic gift cards

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** and **Import CSV**.

## Preparing CSV file for campaign gift cards

<Info>

<Badge color="gray">Import gift cards to campaign prerequisite</Badge>

If you don't have a campaign for your codes yet, [create a gift card campaign](/build/create-gift-cards) first.

</Info>

When adding gift cards to an existing campaign, he CSV should have the following columns:
* **Required:**
    - **Code**
* **Optional:**
    - **Active**
    - **Category**
    - **Redeemed Quantity**
    - Custom metadata fields

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

</Note>

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings as well as validation rules, time frame, redemption limits, and so on.

### Import behavior for selected attributes

Some of the attributes work as follows when imported:
- **Active**:
    - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `TRUE`.
    - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `FALSE`.
- **Metadata**:
    - If metadata is omitted, the voucher inherits the campaign's metadata.
    - If metadata columns are added, the mapped metadata only overrides those specific fields.

### Import gift cards to a campaign

In **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**, go to the gift card campaign where you want to import the cards. In the top right corner, use the three-dot menu to **Import CSV file**.

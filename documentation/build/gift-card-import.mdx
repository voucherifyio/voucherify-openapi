If you need to share codes from other sources with Voucherify, you can handle this scenario using the Import CSV tool in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import:
- Generic gift cards.
- New unique gift cards to a campaign.
- Existing gift cards to update them.

## Preparing CSV file for generic gift cards

To import generic gift cards, prepare a CSV file with your codes and define columns as follows:
- Required:
    - **Voucher Type** (text: `GIFT_VOUCHER`)
    - **Balance** (an integer value - number representing the initial balance)
    - **Code** (the unique gift card code)
- Optional:
    - Category
    - Active (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
    - Start date
    - Expiration date
    - Redeemed quantity
    - Redemption limit
    - Additional Info
    - Formula

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

</Note>

These codes will function as standalone gift cards, independent of a campaign. 

### Import generic gift cards

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** and **Import CSV**.

<Info>

<Badge color="gray">Webhook sendout prerequisite</Badge>

While importing, you can additionally select the checkbox to **Create a webhook sendout for the vouchers created and updated during the import**. This triggers a [Voucher created](/api-reference/voucher/created) or [Voucher updated](/api-reference/voucher/updated) webhook when the coupons are processed.

To enable webhook sendout during the voucher import, first configure webhooks in **Project settings** > **Webhooks**. Select the `voucher.created` and `voucher.updated` events for the sendout to work.

Read [Project settings webhooks](/api-reference/project-settings-webhooks) to learn more about configuring webhooks.

## Preparing CSV file for campaign gift cards

<Info>

<Badge color="gray">Import gift cards to campaign prerequisite</Badge>

If you don't have a campaign for your codes yet, [create a gift card campaign](/build/create-gift-cards) first.

</Info>

When adding gift cards to an existing campaign, he CSV should have the following columns:
* **Required:**
    - **Code**
* **Optional:**
    - **Active**
    - **Category**
    - **Redeemed Quantity**
    - Custom metadata fields

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

<a href="/examples/import-gift-cards-into-campaign-template.csv" download>CSV gift card file template</a>

</Note>

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings as well as validation rules, time frame, redemption limits, and so on.

### Import behavior for selected attributes

Some of the attributes work as follows when imported:
- **Active**:
    - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `TRUE`.
    - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `FALSE`.
- **Metadata**:
    - If metadata is omitted, the voucher inherits the campaign's metadata.
    - If metadata columns are added, the mapped metadata only overrides those specific fields.

### Import gift cards to a campaign

In **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**, go to the gift card campaign where you want to import the cards. In the top right corner, use the three-dot menu to **Import CSV file**.

<VoucherImport/>














To add a field that is unlisted in the built-in properties, change the **Voucherify fields** dropdown to **Metadata (Schema)** or **Metadata (Unknown)** during the mapping step. 

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Understanding metadata overrides">

When a gift card already has a custom attribute, it can be modified, or you can add a new attribute via the import metadata mapping field.

If you want the gift cards to have different attributes than those in the campaign, you must specify them in the appropriate mapping fields in the import file. Otherwise, the campaign's default settings will be applied.

Geofencing is available only in the Enterprise subscription.

</Info>

Use geofencing to create location-specific campaigns with redemption limits based on customers, products, and SKUs geolocations. With geofencing, you can:

- Limit redemptions to customers who share specific locations.
- Decide which products or SKUs will be discounted or excluded based on their current location.
- Exclude particular areas from applying the discount.

Voucherify makes it easy to keep up with customers on the move thanks to the auto-update segments dynamically reacting to location changes.

## Locations manager

The Locations manager lets you create and manage geographic boundaries for your campaigns.

Go to **Locations** in the Dashboard.

### Create a location

1. Click **Create location** in the top right corner.
2. Use the map or search bar to find the required area.
3. Add a location name.
4. Define the boundaries using one of the following tools:
   - **Circle**: Define a radius around a central point.
   - **Polygon**: Draw a custom shape by placing multiple points.
5. Click **Save**.

<Tip>

Each location can be a single point defined by specific coordinates or a multi-coordinate area. You can reuse saved locations in future campaigns.

</Tip>

To the right of every location, click the tricolon ⁝ to access the following options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Show usage** | Shows which resources use the location, such as product collections or customer segments. |

## Create a geofence campaign with customer location

Create campaigns restricted to specific areas. When passing the customer's geolocation with a redemption or validation request, Voucherify verifies if a customer location meets campaign rules.

<Steps>

<Step title="Define a new location">

First, create a location that defines the boundaries for eligible customers.

1. Go to **Locations**.
2. Click **Create location**.
3. Use the map or search bar to find and select the required area.
4. Add a location name and save.

You can highlight areas using a radius or polygon tools. Each polygon is a set of points forming a closed region.

</Step>

<Step title="Add metadata representing the customer's location">

To pass the customer's geolocation to Voucherify, create a new metadata definition in the Customer metadata schema.

1. Go to **Project settings** > **Metadata schema**.
2. Click the three dots next to the **Customer** object and select **Add definition**, or click directly on the **Customer** object name and use the **Create** button.
3. Define a property representing the customer's location.
4. Select **Geopoint** as the metadata type.
5. Save the definition.

<Note>

The **Geopoint** type lets you send coordinates (latitude and longitude in geo URI format) specifying the customer's current location.

</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Create an area-specific customer segment">

Create an auto-update segment that gathers customers from the defined location.

1. Go to **Engagement** > **Customers**.
2. Click **Find and apply filters**.
3. Go to **Custom attributes (metadata)**.
4. Choose the metadata property representing customer location.
5. Define segment criteria using one of your locations.
6. Confirm with the plus and click **Apply**.
7. Save the segment.

The segment gathers all customers who meet its rules and share the matching location. With every update of the customer's location, Voucherify checks if they still meet segment rules and updates the segment accordingly.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a geofence campaign">

Create a campaign and add a segment-based validation rule that limits redemptions to customers from the defined location.

1. Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** > **Create campaign**.
2. Select your campaign type.
3. Configure the campaign settings.
4. In the validation rules step, add a rule that targets the customer segment you created.
5. Save and activate the campaign.

2. Go to **Project settings** > **Metadata schema**.
3. Add a **Geopoint** metadata definition to the **Product** or **SKU** schema.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a product collection">

1. Go to **Campaign hub** > **Product collections**.
2. Create a new collection.
3. Use the location metadata to filter products by their geographic location.
4. Save the collection.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a campaign with product location rules">

1. Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** > **Create campaign**.

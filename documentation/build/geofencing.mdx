<Info>

**Enterprise feature**

Geofencing is available only in the Enterprise subscription. Contact your technical account manager or [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support).

</Info>

Use geofencing to create location-specific campaigns with redemption limits based on customer, product, or SKU locations. You can:

- Limit redemptions to customers in specific locations.
- Discount or exclude products based on their location.
- Exclude particular areas from applying discounts.

Geofencing works with all campaign types: discount coupons, cart promotions, loyalty programs, gift cards, and referral programs.

## How geofencing works

Geofencing uses three components:

1. **Location objects**: Define geographic boundaries using circles or polygons on a map.
2. **Geopoint metadata**: Store coordinates (latitude, longitude) for customers or products.
3. **Segments or collections**: Group customers or products based on their location relative to defined boundaries.

When a customer redeems a voucher, Voucherify checks if their location (passed via metadata) falls within the allowed geographic boundaries defined in your validation rules.

## Manage locations

Go to **Locations** in the dashboard to create and manage location objects.

### Create a location

<Steps>

<Step title="Add location">

Select **Create location** in the top right corner.

</Step>

<Step title="Define boundaries">

Use the map or search bar to find your target area. Define boundaries using:

- **Circle**: Set a center point and radius.
- **Polygon**: Draw a custom shape by placing points on the map.

You can add multiple boundaries to a single location object.

</Step>

<Step title="Save location">

Enter a **Location name** and save. You can reuse this location in future campaigns.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Location manager options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Show usage** | Shows which resources use the location (product collections, customer segments). |
| **Edit** | Modify the location name and boundaries. |
| **Duplicate** | Create a copy of the location with a new name. |
| **Delete** | Remove the location. |

## Geofencing with customer location

Create campaigns that validate customer eligibility based on their geographic location.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a location object">

Go to **Locations** and create a location that defines the allowed area for your customers.

</Step>

<Step title="Add geopoint metadata to customers">

Go to **Project settings** > **Metadata schema** > **Customer**.

Create a new metadata definition:
1. Select **Geopoint** as the metadata type.
2. Name the property (for example, `customer_location`).

This metadata stores coordinates in geo URI format (latitude, longitude).

</Step>

<Step title="Create a customer segment">

Go to **Customers** and create a new auto-update segment:

1. Select **Find and apply filters**.
2. Go to **Custom attributes (metadata)**.
3. Select your geopoint metadata property.
4. Choose a location object to define the segment criteria.
5. Confirm and **Apply**.

The segment automatically updates as customer locations change.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a campaign with validation rules">

Create any campaign type and add a validation rule:

1. In the validation rule builder, add a condition based on **Customer segment**.
2. Select the location-based segment you created.
3. Save the validation rule.

Only customers within the defined geographic area can redeem the campaign.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Pass customer location during redemption

When redeeming a voucher, pass the customer's current location using the geopoint metadata property:

```json
{
  "customer": {
    "source_id": "customer_123",
    "metadata": {
      "customer_location": "geo:40.7128,-74.0060"
    }
  }
}
```

Voucherify validates if the coordinates fall within the allowed location boundaries.

## Geofencing with product location

Create campaigns that validate product eligibility based on geographic location.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a location object">

Go to **Locations** and create a location that defines the allowed area for your products.

</Step>

<Step title="Add geopoint metadata to products">

Go to **Project settings** > **Metadata schema** > **Product**.

Create a new metadata definition:
1. Select **Geopoint** as the metadata type.
2. Name the property (for example, `product_location`).

</Step>

<Step title="Create a product collection">

Go to **Products** and select **Find and apply filters**:

1. Go to **Custom attributes (metadata)**.
2. Select your geopoint metadata property.
3. Choose a location object to define the collection criteria.
4. Confirm and **Apply**.
5. Select **Create dynamic collection** and name it.

</Step>

<Step title="Create a campaign with validation rules">

Create any campaign type and add a validation rule based on the product collection:

- **Include products**: Only products from the collection can be discounted.
- **Require products**: Customer must have products from the collection in their cart.
- **Exclude products**: Products from the collection cannot be discounted.
- **Exclude carts**: Carts containing products from the collection cannot redeem the campaign.

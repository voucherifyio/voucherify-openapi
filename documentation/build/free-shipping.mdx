One of the most powerful ways to use Voucherify is combining multiple discount effects into one voucher.  
With **dynamic discounts**, you can influence prices for the whole cart or specific items based on conditions such as order value, currency, or metadata.

In this tutorial, you will create one coupon that gives **free shipping** (100% off) and a **5% discount** on items.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that:

- You have access to a Voucherify account.
- Your store sends products and shipping as separate cart items to Voucherify.
- Voucherify can recognize your products, either from the Products catalog or from product IDs sent in the API request.

## Prepare your items

Before creating the campaign, make sure Voucherify can recognize both products and shipping.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the products tab">
    Go to the **Products** tab in Voucherify.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make sure shipping is a separate line item">
    Make sure shipping is sent as a separate cart item that Voucherify can recognize (for example, an item named *Shipping* or a dedicated shipping item ID).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign products to a collection">
    Make sure your products belong to a product collection so they can be discounted (for example, **All Products**).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exclude shipping from discounted collections">
    Make sure the shipping item is **not included** in the discounted product collection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You do not need to import your full product catalog. You can also pass product IDs as metadata in API calls.

## Launch the campaign

Create a discount coupon campaign that will include both discounts.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select campaign type">
    Go to **Campaigns**, click the **plus (+)** icon, and choose **Discount Coupons**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure general details">
    - Choose **Generic code**.  
    - Set a custom code name (for example, `COMBO5`).  
    - Set the **redemption limit** to **Unlimited**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set timeframe">
    Define the start and end dates.  
    If you want the campaign to run without an end date, leave the expiration date empty.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configure free shipping and item discount

In this section, you will create **two price rules** inside one voucher using **New price**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select discount type">
    In the discount configuration step, select **Products discounts** and **New price**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a second rule">
    Click **Add another** to create a second definition field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set free shipping">
    - Click **Select products** in the first rule.  
    - Select your **Shipping** item.  
    - In the **New price** field, enter `0`.  

    This overrides the shipping price and makes shipping free.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a 5% item discount">
    - Click **Select collections** in the second rule.  
    - Select **All Products** (or another collection you want to discount).  
    - Set a **fallback value** that is safe for your business.  

    The fallback is used only if the formula cannot be calculated. A common safe option is the original item price.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the dynamic discount formula">
    Open the **formula builder** and create this formula:

    - Select **Order item → Price**  
    - Add the **Multiply (*)** operator  
    - Add **Number** and enter `0.95`

    This sets the new price to 95% of the original price, giving a 5% discount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the campaign">
    - Click **Next step**  
    - Skip metadata if you do not need it  
    - Review the summary  
    - Save the campaign
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Notify customers

Inform customers about the promotion using your preferred channels.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a communication method">
    You can notify customers using:
    - Voucherify distribution tools  
    - Web banners  
    - Checkout or cart pop-ups  
    - Email or push notifications
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customers redeem the discount">
    When customers apply the coupon at checkout, they will receive **free shipping** and a **5% item discount** at the same time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alternatives

This setup can also be used in other campaign types:

- **Cart promotion**  
  The discount is applied automatically when conditions are met. No codes are generated.

- **Unique codes campaign**  
  Codes are generated in bulk and assigned to customers using the Distribution or Publish API.

Both options support dynamic discounts and similar price rules.

Validation rules define conditions that must be met for a successful redemption, loyalty point assignment, or distribution trigger. Use validation rules to control when and how customers can use your incentives.

## Where to use validation rules

Validation rules can be assigned to:

- **Discounts and campaign codes**: Limit redemptions by time, publication, or discount amount.
- **Earning rules in loyalty campaigns**: Define circumstances that trigger loyalty point assignments.

<Note>
For product discounts in the Campaign builder, Voucherify automatically creates a validation rule that includes all discounted products. You can edit this rule to add or remove conditions, but you cannot remove it from the campaign.
</Note>

## Access the validation rule builder

You can create validation rules in three locations:

- **Campaign builder**: The primary option. Navigate to the **Discount value** step and select **Conditions**. Rules created here are automatically assigned to the campaign and added to the **Validation rules** tab in **Campaign hub**.
- **Campaign details**: Go to the **Discount** tab in an existing campaign's details.
- **Validation rules manager**: Go to **Campaign hub** > **Validation rules** to create rules for future use.

## Create a validation rule

<Steps>

<Step>

### Open the rule builder

In the Campaign builder, navigate to the **Discount value** step and select **Conditions**. You can:

- Create a new validation rule
- Select and optionally edit an existing rule
- Clone and optionally edit an existing rule

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure rule settings

In the rule builder pop-over, configure the following:

- **Name** (optional): Voucherify creates a default name if you leave this empty.
- **Error message** (optional): A message displayed in the API response when the validation rule is not met.
- **Rules**: The conditions that influence validation.

</Step>

<Step>

### Add rules

Click **Add rules** to select a rule. Use the search field to find rules by name.

Available rule categories:

- **Audience**: Customer segments, customer metadata, customer location
- **Products**: Specific products, product collections, product metadata
- **Prices & Quantities**: Order value, item quantities, cart structure
- **Metadata**: Order metadata, redemption metadata
- **Budget constraints**: Total discount amount, total redemption count
- **Redemptions**: Redemption count per customer, redemption frequency

When you add a rule, specify conditions like "is", "is more than", or "after". You can add multiple conditions within one rule.

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure junctions and brackets

When building complex scenarios with multiple rules, use junctions and brackets.

**Junctions** separate each pair of rules. Click a junction to change it:

- **AND**: Both rules must be met for the discount to apply.
- **OR**: Only one rule must be met for the discount to apply.

**Brackets** group conditions together. Use them to create complex logical expressions.

</Step>

<Step>

### Save the rule

Review your configuration and save the validation rule. The rule is automatically assigned to your campaign.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Manage existing rules

In the Campaign builder or campaign details, you can:

- **Show rules**: View an assigned validation rule by clicking **Show rules**.
- **Edit rule**: Open the pop-over window to modify an existing rule.
- **Duplicate rule**: Create a copy of the selected rule.
- **Remove rule**: Remove the assigned validation rule from the campaign.

## Advanced rule configuration

### Subrules

Subrules add additional requirements within a rule. They are available only for **Any order item** and **Every order item** validation rules.

### Rule arrangement

Rearrange rules using drag and drop:

- Move rules and brackets freely.
- Add or remove rules from brackets by dragging.
- Subrules can only be moved within their group, but their order can be changed.
- After moving a rule, a logical **AND** connector is added automatically, and rule numbering updates.

### Additional rule options

- **Add subrule**: Add a rule within the rule for additional requirements.
- **Add next rule**: Add a new rule after the selected one.
- **Add next brackets**: Create brackets after the selected rule.
- **Surround with brackets**: Create brackets around the selected rule.

## Create rules in the validation rules manager

<Info>
Creating validation rules in the validation rules manager is recommended for advanced users who want to create reusable rules.
</Info>

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Validation rules** to access the validation rules manager. The process is similar to creating rules in the Campaign builder, with one difference: you must first choose the **context** for your validation rule.

The context defines which rules are available based on the discount type you select.

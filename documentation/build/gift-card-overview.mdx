## Gift card campaigns

A gift card campaign in Voucherify can create a pool of unique, prepaid digital cards that customers can redeem for purchases. They are a powerful tool for driving sales and encouraging customer loyalty.

The **Build** section is where you define the core mechanics of your gift card program. Every setting you configure, from the initial value to the redemption rules, maps directly to how Voucherify stores and processes the card data and, ultimately, impacts the customer experience.

<Tip>

Gift cards function as a form of currency within your system. Unlike one-time use coupons, a single gift card can be redeemed multiple times until its **balance** is depleted.

</Tip>

## Key gift card concepts

Gift cards operate on three key concepts. Understanding these is essential for effective campaign design.

<CardGroup cols={3}>

<Card title="Balance" icon="wallet">

Gift cards are loaded with an **Initial amount** (value) that customers spend. This amount can be reduced (redeemed) or increased (topped up).

</Card>

<Card title="Uniqueness" icon="tag">

Each card within the campaign is assigned a **Unique code** that is tracked individually for security and reporting.

</Card>

<Card title="Validation" icon="shield-check">

**Validation rules** can restrict *where* and *when* a customer can use the card (for example, minimum cart value, specific products, metadata).

</Card>

## Gift card configuration in the Build section

When creating a new gift card campaign, you will configure these key areas. For detailed, step-by-step instructions, refer to the [**How-to Guide: Create a Gift Card Campaign**](/build/create-gift-cards).

* **Campaign type:** Select **Gift vouchers** to create prepaid, balance-holding codes.
* **Code settings:** Configure the **Code pattern** and quantity of unique cards to be generated.
* **Value:** Set the **Initial amount** loaded onto each card.
* **Validation rules:** Define the **Validation rules** that govern *where* and *when* the card can be used.

## Gift Card Campaigns

A Gift Card campaign in Voucherify creates a pool of unique, prepaid digital cards that customers can redeem for purchases. They are a powerful tool for driving sales and encouraging customer loyalty.

The **Build** section is where you define the core mechanics of your Gift Card program. Every setting you configure—from the initial value to the redemption rules—maps directly to how Voucherify stores and processes the card data and, ultimately, impacts the customer experience.

<Tip>

Gift cards function as a form of currency within your system. Unlike one-time use coupons, a single gift card can be redeemed multiple times until its **balance** is depleted.

## Key Mechanics of Gift Cards

Gift Cards operate on three key mechanics. Understanding these is essential for effective campaign design.

<Card title="Balance" icon="wallet">

Gift cards are loaded with an **Initial Balance** (value) that customers spend. This balance can be reduced (redeemed) or increased (topped up).

</Card>

<Card title="Uniqueness" icon="tag">

Each card within the campaign is assigned a **Unique Code** that is tracked individually for security and reporting.

</Card>

<Card title="Validation" icon="shield-check">

**Validation Rules** restrict *where* and *when* a customer can use the card (e.g., minimum cart value, specific products).

## Configuration Areas in the Build Section

When creating a new Gift Card campaign, you will configure these key areas. For detailed, step-by-step instructions on the creation process, refer to the [**How-to Guide: Create a Gift Card Campaign**](/build/create-gift-cards).

* **Campaign Type:** Ensure **Gift Vouchers** is selected to issue prepaid, balance-holding codes.
* **Code Settings:** Configure the **Code Pattern** and quantity of unique cards to be generated.
* **Value:** Set the **Initial Balance** loaded onto each card.
* **Validation Rules:** Define the **Validation Rules** that govern *where* and *when* the card can be used.

Referral programs turn your existing customers into brand advocates. By rewarding users for inviting their friends, you create a self-sustaining growth loop that lowers acquisition costs and increases customer lifetime value.

Learn how referral mechanics work, from rewarding the referrer and the referee to managing multi-level programs.

## Key referral concepts

The following concepts are key for understanding the referral program.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Referrer (advocate)">
    The existing customer who shares their unique **referral code** with others. They receive a reward once their friend redeems the code or performs the custom event.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referee (friend)">
    The new customer who joins using a **referral code** or performs the custom event. They often receive a "welcome" incentive to encourage their first interaction with your brand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referral code">
    A unique code assigned to a **referrer**. When a **referee** redeems (uses) this code, Voucherify links the two profiles to track the successful conversion event.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversion event">
    It defines an action that converts a new customer to a **referee**. It can be a custom event passed using the API or the **referral code** redemption. Once Voucherify recognizes a new conversion event, the related customer is marked as referred and the **referrer** has another successful referral.
  </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Referral tier">
    A reward level that defines when and how a referrer is rewarded. Tiers enable milestone-based and multi-level referral programs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reward">
    An incentive issued to referrers and, in double-sided programs, to referees. Rewards can include discounts, gift credits, or loyalty points.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referral code publication">
    The assignment of a referral code to a specific customer. Codes must be published before a customer can start referring others.

    Additionally, codes can be shared with other customers, so more people can share one code, even though they aren't a **referrer**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Join-once campaign">
    A setting for referral programs that ensures a customer can hold only one **referral code** per campaign. Once set, this can't be toggled off in the **Dashboard**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-update campaign">
    An optional mode where the application automatically generates new unique **referral codes** when the initial batch runs out.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Double-sided program">
    **Double-sided referral programs** reward both referrers and referred customers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Single-sided program">
    **Single-sided referral program** reward only referrers. Referees don't receive any rewards.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Referral workflow

Voucherify supports the referral program lifecycle through the following stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Build your referral logic in the **Dashboard**. This includes selecting **conversion event**, reward **tiers** and **criteria**, and defining specific **rewards**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enrollment and sharing">
    Assign **referral code**s to your advocates. You can use **distributions** to send these codes via email, text messages, or display them directly in your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Conversion">
    When a friend performs the **conversion event** (code redemption or custom event), they provide the **referrer**'s **referral code**. Voucherify checks the code and records the link between the **referrer** and the **referee**.

    For double-sided programs, the referee receives their reward at this step.
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reward triggering">
    Once the defined **criteria** in a referral tier are met, Voucherify automatically triggers the reward for the referrer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analysis">
    Track the performance of your referral campaigns using real-time reports to understand what drives customer engagement.
  </Step>

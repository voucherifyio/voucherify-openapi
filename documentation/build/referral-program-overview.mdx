Referral programs turn your existing customers into brand advocates. By rewarding users for inviting their friends, you create a self-sustaining growth loop that lowers acquisition costs and increases customer lifetime value.

In this guide, you will learn how referral mechanics work, from rewarding the referrer and the referee to managing multi-level programs.

## Key referral concepts

The following concepts are key for understanding the referral program.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Referrer (advocate)">
    The existing customer who shares their unique referral code with others. They receive a reward once their friend completes a specific action, such as making a first purchase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referee (friend)">
    The new customer who joins using a referral code. They often receive a "welcome" incentive to encourage their first interaction with your brand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referral code">
    A unique identifier assigned to a referrer. When a referee uses this code, Voucherify links the two profiles to track the successful conversion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversion event">
    The specific action a referee must take for the referrer to earn a reward. Common events include "order paid," "customer created," or custom events triggered via API.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reward tiers and criteria">
    Referral rewards are organized into tiers. For each tier, you select the criteria that grant a reward to the referrer:
    * **Each unique referee redemption** – the referrer is rewarded for every unique redemption made by a friend.
    * **Minimum unique referee redemptions** – the referrer receives a reward only after a specific number of unique redemptions take place. This option allows for additional filters to further define the criteria.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Join-once campaign">
    A setting for referral programs that ensures a customer can hold only one referral code per campaign. Once set, this cannot be toggled off in the **Dashboard**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-update campaign">
    An optional mode where the application automatically generates new unique referral codes when the initial batch runs out.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Referral workflow

Voucherify supports the referral program lifecycle through the following stages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Build your referral logic in the **Dashboard**. This includes naming your **tier**, selecting the reward **criteria**, and defining the specific **rewards** for that tier.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enrollment and sharing">
    Assign referral codes to your advocates. You can use **distributions** to send these codes via email, SMS, or display them directly in your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attribution">
    When a friend signs up or buys something, they provide the advocate's referral code. Voucherify validates the code and records the link between the referrer and the referee.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reward triggering">
    Once the referee meets the defined **criteria** in a tier, Voucherify automatically triggers the reward for the referrer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analysis">
    Track the performance of your referral campaigns using real-time reports to understand what drives customer engagement.

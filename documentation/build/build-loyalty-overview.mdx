Loyalty programs allow customers to store points on digital cards. Customers accumulate these points by meeting specific program earning rules. 

Beyond managing loyalty cards and earning rules, Voucherify provides a rewards catalog and an omnichannel notifications system to provide a fully gamified experience.

In this guide, you will learn how loyalty programs work—from simple collect-and-spend schemes to advanced campaigns with tiers, expiration logic, and automatic redemption.

## Key loyalty concepts

The following concepts are key for understanding the loyalty engine.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Loyalty card">
    A digital card with a unique code that acts as a digital wallet for a customer's points.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Earning rule">
    Defines the action(s) that assign a specific number of loyalty points to a customer's card. Each earning rule has a specific timeframe determining when it is active.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Loyalty tier">
    Levels of membership within your program. A tier is defined by a minimum and maximum point range on a customer's card. You can map different rewards and earning rules to specific tiers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reward">
    A digital or material incentive customers receive in exchange for points. Customers can also spend points to pay for orders directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Distribution">
    The mechanism for sending messages from Voucherify to end customers or third-party applications. This is used to deliver loyalty cards and notify customers about collected points or redeemed rewards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reward redemption">
    The exchange of points for a reward. This process deducts points and updates the balance on the loyalty card.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Loyalty card publication">
    The assignment of a unique card to a specific customer. Cards must be published before customers can start collecting points.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Loyalty points expiration">
    Points can expire within a pre-defined timeframe. Expiration rules can be set at the campaign level or the earning rule level. If no rule is defined, points do not expire.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-join campaign">
    An optional mode where customers are automatically assigned a loyalty card when they meet an earning rule, provided they don't already have one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Join-once campaign">
    The default setting for loyalty programs. It ensures a customer can hold only one card per campaign. Once set, this cannot be toggled off in the **Dashboard**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Auto-update campaign">
    An optional mode where the application automatically generates new loyalty codes when the initial batch runs out.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Loyalty workflow

Voucherify supports every step of the loyalty program lifecycle.

    When a customer wants to use a reward (such as a discount, gift card, or pay-with-points), Voucherify validates the request and processes the redemption in your store.

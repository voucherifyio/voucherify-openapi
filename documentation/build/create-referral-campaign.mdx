The referral campaign builder guides you through the following steps to launch your program.

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** to **Create campaign** and select **Referral codes**.

<CampaignDraft/>

<Steps>

<Step>

## Program size

<CampDetails />

3. Optionally, provide a **Description** for internal reference.
4. Optionally, enable **Customers can join campaign only once** to ensure each customer can own only one referral code in this campaign.

Next, define campaign size:
- Set **Code count** to define how many referral codes are generated when the campaign is created.
- Enable **Auto-increase voucher count** to automatically generate new referral codes when the initial pool is exhausted.

<CodeSettings/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Timeframe

<TimeFrame/>

- Set **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to ensure referral codes expire after a defined time once assigned to customers.

</Step>

<Step>

## Incentive workflow

Select the conversion event and define if the referral program is single-single (referrer is rewarded) or double-sided (both referrer and referee are rewarded).

<Steps>

<Step title="Choose conversion event">

Select the event that marks a referral as successful.

You can choose one of the following:

- **Code redemption**  
  The referee redeems the referral code (for example, during checkout).  
  
  A successful redemption means a successful referral.

- **Custom event** 

  <Info>

    <Badge color="gray">Prerequisite: Developer setup</Badge>

    Tracking custom events in your system requires sending them to Voucherify through [POST Track custom events](/api-reference/events/track-custom-event) API endpoint.

  </Info>

  The referral is confirmed by an API custom event (for example, `subscription_paid`, `social_media_sign_up`).

  Select a custom event or create a new one.
  
  Voucherify records a successful referral when it receives the event together with a referral code.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose who will be rewarded">

Decide how incentives are distributed in your referral program:

- **Referrer** (single-sided)  
  Only the referrer receives a reward.

- **Referrer and referee** (double-sided)  
  Both the referrer and the invited customer receive rewards.

If you choose **Referrer and referee**, the referee-specific steps will be available later in the builder.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Step>

<Step>

## Referee eligibility

<Info>

This step includes **Referee reward** panel only when you selected **Referrer and referee** in the **Incentive workflow** step.

If you selected **Referrer**, you can also add a **Validation rule**.

</Info>

Define how the **referee is rewarded** after a successful referral conversion.

<Steps>

<Step title="Referee reward type">

If **Referrer and referee** is selected in the **Incentive workflow** step, choose what the invited customer receives:

- **Discount coupon** – apply a discount to the referee’s order.
- **Credits on gift card** – add a balance to the referee’s gift card in an existing gift card campaign.
- **Points on loyalty card** – add loyalty points to the referee's loyalty card in an existing loyalty campaign.

</Step>

<Step title="Reward configuration">

Configure the selected reward type:

- **Discount coupon**
  - Define discount type, value, and conditions (validation rule).
  - Control when and how the discount is applied to orders.

- **Credits on gift card**
  - Define the gift amount.
  - Select the target gift card campaign.

- **Points on loyalty card**
  - Define the number of loyalty points.
  - Select the target loyalty campaign.

</Step>

<Step title="Validation rule">

<Info>

  The **Validation rule** step is available only for **Credits on gift card** and **Points on loyalty card**. For **Discount coupon**, add a **Validation rule** in the **Conditions** step in the discount builder.

  You can also add a **Validation rule** when only the **Referrer** is rewarded. 

</Info>

Optionally, add or create a validation rule to restrict when the referee reward can be granted (for example, new customers only or order value conditions).

<Tip>

For single-sided referral campaigns, it's recommended to set the **Redemptions per customer in a campaign** rule to **less than or equal to 1**. This way, each referee can use a referral code from this campaign only once. Referees won't be able to redeem one code twice or use referral codes from several referrers.

</Tip>

<ValRule/>

</Step>

</Steps>

</Step>

<Step>

## Referrer rewards

**Create tier** to configure rewards for referrers with **referral tiers**.

  <Steps>

  <Step title="Tier criteria">

  Select how referrers qualify for rewards:

  - **Each unique referee redemption** – reward the referrer for every successful referral.
  - **Minimum unique referee redemptions** – reward the referrer after reaching a defined number of successful referrals. You can **Add filter** to create a customer segment that a referrer must be part of to receive a reward.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Reward configuration">

  Add a **Digital** (a discount coupon, credits on a gift card, points on a loyalty card) or **Material** (a product) reward. Optionally, create a new reward.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Channels">

  Add distribution channels that trigger notifications when all reward criteria are met and a reward is assigned to the referrer.

  </Step>

  </Steps>

You can configure multiple referral tiers within one campaign.

</Step>

<Step>

## Distributions (optional)

Set up automatic messages sent when referral events occur. Messages can be sent to customers or external systems using channels such as email, SMS, webhooks, or integrations.

<Note>

The distribution builder is preconfigured for the selected event. The only step to configure is **Channels**.

</Note>

<Steps>

<Step>

**Add distribution** and select the event:
- **Successfully published** – used when a voucher is successfully published to a customer.
- **Customer was referred** – used when a new customer joins through a referral.

</Step>

<Step>

In the distribution builder, **Name distribution**.

</Step>

<Step>

Go to **Channels** to **Add channels**. You can add one or more distribution channels.

</Step>

<Step>

In **Summary**, review the configuration and **Save** the distribution.

</Step>

</Steps>

You can add many distributions to a referral program.

The referral campaign builder guides you through the following steps to launch your program.

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** to **Create campaign** and select **Referral codes**.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Program size

<CampDetails />

3. Optionally, provide a **Description** for internal reference.
4. Optionally, enable **Customers can join campaign only once** to ensure each customer can own only one referral code in this campaign.

- Set **Code count** to define how many referral codes are generated when the campaign is created.
- Enable **Auto-increase voucher count** to automatically generate new referral codes when the initial pool is exhausted.

<CodeSettings/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Timeframe

<TimeFrame/>

- Set **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to ensure referral codes expire after a defined time once assigned to customers.

</Step>

<Step>

## Incentive workflow

Select the event that marks a referral as successful.

<Steps>

<Step title="Choose conversion event">

Select the event that marks a referral as successful.

You can choose one of the following:

- **Code redemption**  
  The referee redeems the referral code (for example, during checkout).  
  A successful redemption equals a successful referral.

- **Custom event**  
  The referral is confirmed by an API event (for example, `subscription_paid`).  
  Voucherify records a successful referral when it receives the event together with a referral code.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose who will be rewarded">

Decide how incentives are distributed in your referral program:

- **Referrer** (single-sided)  
  Only the referrer receives a reward.

- **Referrer and referee** (double-sided)  
  Both the referrer and the invited customer receive rewards.

This selection determines whether referee-specific steps are available later in the builder.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Step>

<Step>

## Referee eligibility

<Info>

This step is available only for **double-sided referral programs**.

</Info>

Define how the **referee is rewarded** after a successful referral conversion.

<Steps>

<Step title="Referee reward type">

Choose what the invited customer receives:

- **Discount coupon** – apply a discount to the referee’s order.
- **Credits on gift card** – add a balance to the referee’s gift card.
- **Points on loyalty card** – grant loyalty points to the referee.

</Step>

<Step title="Reward configuration">

Configure the selected reward type:

- **Discount coupon**
  - Define discount type, value, and conditions.
  - Control when and how the discount is applied to orders.

- **Credits on gift card**
  - Define the gift amount.
  - Select or create a gift card campaign.

- **Points on loyalty card**
  - Define the number of loyalty points.
  - Select the target loyalty campaign.

</Step>

<Step title="Validation rule (optional)">

Optionally, apply a validation rule to restrict when the referee reward can be granted
(for example, new customers only or order value conditions).

You can:
- Select an existing rule.
- Edit or clone an existing rule.
- Create a new rule.

<ValRule/>

</Step>

</Steps>

</Step>

<Step>

## Referrer rewards

Configure rewards for referrers using **referral tiers**.

<Steps>

<Step title="Tier criteria">

Select how referrers qualify for rewards:

- **Each unique referee redemption** – reward the referrer for every successful referral.
- **Minimum unique referee redemptions** – reward the referrer after reaching a defined number of successful referrals.

</Step>

<Step title="Reward configuration">

Select a campaign that will be used as the source of rewards. Voucherify will publish vouchers, credits, or points from the selected campaign and assign them to customers when the reward is triggered. Optionally, you can add metadata to tag the reward for tracking or integrations.

</Step>

<Step title="Metadata (optional)">

Optionally, add metadata to referral tiers.

<NoteMetadata/>

</Step>

</Steps>

You can configure multiple referral tiers within one campaign.

</Step>

<Step>

## Distributions (optional)

Set up automatic messages sent when referral events occur. Messages can be sent to customers or external systems using channels such as email, SMS, webhooks, or integrations.

<Note>

The distribution builder is preconfigured for the selected event. The only step to configure is **Channels**.

</Note>

<Steps>

<Step>

**Add distribution** and select the event:
- **Referral code published**
- **Referee rewarded**
- **Referrer rewarded**

</Step>

<Step>

Name the distribution.

</Step>

<Step>

Add one or more **Channels**.

</Step>

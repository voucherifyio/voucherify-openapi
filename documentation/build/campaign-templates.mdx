Campaign templates allow you to save a configuration of a created promotion tier, discount coupon, or gift voucher campaign and recreate it later.

<Note>

**Referrals and loyalty programs are not supported.**

</Note>

## Purpose and benefits

Campaign templates assist in campaign management by providing the following benefits:

* **Rapid setup**: Quickly setting up new campaigns with a similar configuration.
* **Team enablement**: Making it easier for your team members to create campaigns.
* **Project migration**: Copying them to other projects, such as moving a campaign configuration from a test environment to a production environment.
* **Library creation**: Creating a library of campaigns to be used in the future.

## Permissions

Users must have permissions granted by the account administrator to perform actions related to campaign templates. Permissions are required for basic template management and for the creation of new campaigns from a template. Furthermore, specific optional permissions must be enabled to modify resources included in the template during the campaign creation process (e.g., creating a new validation rule or segment).

**Required permissions**

* **Template management**: Permission from the account admin to create, read, or delete campaign templates.
* **Campaign creation**: Permission to create campaigns, required to create a new campaign from an existing template.

**Optional permissions**

These permissions are required if you need to create new related resources while using the template:

* **Validation rules**: Required if a new validation rule is to be created.
* **Customers (segments)**: Required if a new segment is to be created.
* **Products**: Required if a new product collection, product, or SKU is to be created.
* **Location**: Required if a new location is to be created.

### Dashboard operations

Campaign templates are managed primarily through the dashboard interface.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a template">
1.  Select an existing campaign from the **Campaigns** tab in the dashboard.
2.  In the upper right corner, click on the **star-folder image**.
    <Warning>
    You cannot create a template out of a draft campaign.
    </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Locate templates">
Templates are listed in the **Templates** tab of the **Campaign Hub** section. The list shows details like the template's name, description, campaign type, and creation time.
</Step>
</Steps>

#### Template actions

Clicking on the three dots next to a template reveals the following actions:

* **Create campaign**: Creates a new campaign from the template. You can either leave the configuration as it is or change it.
* **Copy**: Copies the campaign template to a selected project and allows you to change its name and description.
* **Edit**: Edits the campaign template’s name and description within the current project.
* **Delete**: Deletes the campaign template.

#### Cluster and project behavior

<Info>
Campaign templates are specific to their **cluster**. You can only create a campaign from a template that exists on the same cluster.
</Info>

* **Cross-cluster copy**: You can copy a template to a project that is on a different cluster and create a campaign there.
* **Target project switch**: When a campaign is created out of a template in a different project, the template itself is **not** copied to the campaign template list in the target project. The user is automatically switched to the target project.

### Promotion tier templates

<Info>
You can only create templates out of **individual promotion tiers**. The feature does not support creating a template for the whole promotion campaign.
</Info>

To create a promotion tier template:

1.  Select an existing promotion tier.
2.  The promotion tier is saved as a template of a discount campaign.
3.  The promotion campaign must first be saved as a draft or released before a promotion tier can be converted into a template.

Once the template is created, you can:
* Create a new promotion tier using any existing promotion tier or discount campaign template.
* Create a new discount campaign using any existing promotion tier or discount campaign template.

### Configuration resource handling

When you create a campaign from a template, its resources will be **created, cloned, or used again**.


<Warning>
When you click **Confirm** in the **Campaign Resource Summary**, the new resources listed there will be created or cloned within the project, even if you leave the campaign creation wizard.
</Warning>

#### 1. Resources will be created

Resources are created when they do not exist or have been changed since the template was saved:

* **Does not exist**: A validation rule is added because the template is used in a project which does not have it yet.
* **Restored**: An SKU was permanently deleted and it is restored from a template.
* **Changed**: A validation rule or static collection used in the template has been changed in the meantime, so it will be created again.

#### 2. Resources will be cloned

* **Cloned**: An existing validation rule used in the template is copied so it can be used separately in a new campaign. This prevents changes from being introduced to other campaigns that use the validation rule saved in the template.

#### 3. Resources will be used again

Resources are reused when they already exist and have not been modified:

* A product collection is reused in its current state because it already exists in the project and it has not been changed.

#### Product/SKU specific handling

* **Dynamic segments**: Only the configuration of the dynamic customer segments is copied. To fill a segment, you can import customers from the other project.
* **Discounting main product**: When discounting a main product, all its SKUs will be recreated in the new project.
* **Discounting SKU**: When discounting an SKU, only the selected SKUs will be recreated, including the main product in the new project.
* **Modified resources**: If the product or SKU has been modified in the meantime, its current state is used. For example, if the price has been changed from \$10 to \$15, the product will be reused with the current price of \$15 and not copied or recreated with the original \$10 price.
* **In-bin products**: Any products/SKUs currently in the bin make it impossible to use the template since `source_id` is a unique identifier that cannot be reused.
* **Backup function**: Resources deleted after the template’s creation will still be correctly reproduced in any project. The template can serve as a backup for your resources.

### Metadata schema and custom event schema

Definitions of metadata and custom events are **never created** by copying the template to a different project or if they have been deleted. However, products containing the metadata are completely recreated, meaning all products will have proper metadata.

The template stores information about:
* **Metadata**: Properties along with their required types.
* **Custom events**: Only the names without properties and types.

#### Schema statuses

Schemas, just like other resources, have their own statuses when a campaign is created from a template:

| Status | Description | Action/Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schemas matched** | The schema present in the template matches the schema in the project. | The campaign is created from the template. |
| **Schemas differ** | The schema type in the template differs from the one in the project. | The campaign template **cannot be created**. This outcome is available for metadata schema only. Contact your project administrator or the account owner to modify the metadata definitions in this project. |
| **Schemas missing** | The schema in the project does not correspond to any schema in the project. | You can create the campaign from the template, however, the campaign may not work correctly. Ask the project administrator or the account owner to configure the definitions manually or through the **Management API** (Enterprise feature). |

<Note>
If the metadata types saved in the template differ from those defined in the project, you **cannot** create a campaign from the template.

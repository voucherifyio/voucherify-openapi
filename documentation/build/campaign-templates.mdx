Campaign templates allow you to save a configuration of a created promotion tier, discount coupon, or gift voucher campaign and recreate it later.

<Note>

Referrals and loyalty programs are not supported.

</Note>

## Purpose

Campaign templates help you manage campaigns by ensuring:
* **Rapid setup**: Quickly setting up new campaigns with a similar configuration.
* **Team enablement**: Making it easier for your team members to create campaigns.
* **Project migration**: Copying them to other projects, such as moving a campaign configuration from a test environment to a production environment.
* **Library creation**: Creating a library of campaigns to be used in the future.

## Permissions

Users need permissions granted by the account owner to perform actions related to campaign templates.

Required permissions:
* **Campaign templates**: Permission to create, read, or delete campaign templates.
* **Campaigns**: Permission to create campaigns, required to create a new campaign from an existing template.

Optional permissions for creating related resources:
* **Validation rules**: For adding or cloning validation rules.
* **Customers (segments)**: For creating customer segments.
* **Products**: For creating a new product collection, product, or SKU.
* **Locations**: For creating a new location.

## Campaign template object details

A template saves the following elements of campaign configuration.

## Dashboard operations

Campaign templates are managed through the dashboard.

### Creating a campaign template

In Voucherify dashboard, go to **Campaigns hub** > **Campaigns** or **Promotion tiers**:
1. Select an existing campaign or an individual promotion tier.
2. In the upper right corner, click on the **star-folder icon** or **Create template**.
3. Name the template and, optionally, add description.
        
<Warning>

    You cannot create a template out of a draft campaign.

</Warning>

Templates are listed in the **Templates** tab of the **Campaign hub** section.

### Using campaign templates

In a campaign template, click the three-dot menu to:
* **Create campaign**: Opens a builder to create a new campaign from the template. You can either leave the configuration as it is or change it.
* **Copy**: Copies the campaign template to a selected project. You can change its name and description.
* **Edit**: Edits the campaign template’s name and description within the current project.
* **Delete**: Deletes the campaign template.

Discount campaign templates can be also used to create promotion tiers and the other way round; promotion tier templates can be used to create discount campaigns.

<Info>

    When a campaign is created out of a template in a different project, the template itself is not copied to the campaign template list in the target project.

</Info>

## Template resources behavior

When you create a campaign from a template, its resources will be **created, cloned, or used again**.

<Warning>
When you click **Confirm** in the **Campaign Resource Summary**, the new resources listed there will be created or cloned within the project, even if you leave the campaign builder.
</Warning>

### Create a new resource

New resources are created when they don't exist or have been changed since the template was saved:
* **Does not exist**: A validation rule is added because the template is used in a project which does not have it yet.
* **Restored**: An SKU was permanently deleted and it is restored from a template.
* **Changed**: A validation rule or static collection used in the template has been changed in the meantime, so it will be created again.

### Clone resource

A resource is cloned for example when an existing validation rule used in the template is copied so it can be used separately in a new campaign. This prevents changes from being introduced to other campaigns that use the validation rule saved in the template.

### Resources will be used again

Resources are reused when they already exist and haven't been modified:

For example, a product collection is reused in its current state because it already exists in the project and it has not been changed.

### Specific resource behavior

The following resources behave in specific ways depending on the case:
* **Dynamic segments**: Only the configuration of the dynamic customer segments is copied between projects. To fill a segment, you can import customers from the other project.
* **Discounting main product**: When discounting a main product, all its SKUs will be recreated in the new project.
* **Discounting SKU**: When discounting an SKU, only the selected SKUs will be recreated, including the main product in the new project.
* **Modified resources**: If the product or SKU has been modified in the meantime, its current state is used. For example, if the price has been changed from \$10 to \$15, the product will be reused with the current price of \$15 and not copied or recreated with the original \$10 price.
* **In-bin products**: Any products/SKUs currently in the bin make it impossible to use the template since `source_id` is a unique identifier that cannot be reused.
* **Backup function**: Resources deleted after the template’s creation will still be correctly reproduced in any project. The template can serve as a backup for your resources.

### Metadata schema and custom event schema

Definitions of metadata and custom events are **never created** by copying the template to a different project or if they have been deleted. However, products containing the metadata are completely recreated, meaning all products will have proper metadata.

The template stores information about:
* **Metadata**: Properties along with their required types.
* **Custom events**: Only the names without properties and types.

<Tip>

    Before using a template in a new project, recreate relevant metadata or custom event schemas.

</Tip>

#### Schema statuses

Schemas, just like other resources, have their own statuses when a campaign is created from a template:

| Status | Description | Action/Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schemas matched** | The schema present in the template matches the schema in the project. | The campaign is created from the template. |
| **Schemas differ** | The schema type in the template differs from the one in the project. | The campaign template **cannot be created**. This outcome is available for metadata schema only. Contact your project administrator or the account owner to modify the metadata definitions in this project. |
| **Schemas missing** | The schema in the template does not correspond to any schema in the project. | You can create the campaign from the template, however, the campaign may not work correctly. Ask the project administrator or the account owner to configure the schema definitions. |

<Note>

    If the metadata types saved in the template differ from those defined in the project (for example string in one project, object in the other project), you **cannot** create a campaign from the template.

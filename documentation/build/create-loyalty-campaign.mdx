The loyalty campaign builder guides you through the following steps to launch your program.

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** to **Create campaign** and select **Loyalty program**.

<Steps>

<Step>

    ## Campaign details

    <CampDetails />
    3. Optionally, provide a **Description** for internal reference.
    4. Optionally, set **New customers will auto-join campaign once any earning rule is fulfilled** for allowing customers to join the loyalty program when they meet the condition of an earning rule.

    <TimeFrame/>
    - Set **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to ensure that vouchers expire in a defined time after they were assigned to a customer.

    - Set **Loyalty card count** to generate a given number of loyalty cards when the campaign is created.

    <CodeSettings/>

</Step>

<Step>

    ## Point expiration and earning rules

    Set expiration rules for points to determine if customers have a limited time to use their points. Also, set earning rules to define when and under what conditions customers get loyalty points.

    ### Point expiration rules

    Point expiration can be set globally at the campaign level – all points earned through earning rules will follow the same expiration rule.

    You can set the following point expiration rules:
    - **No expiration**: Points never expire. Customers have unlimited time to redeem points for rewards.
    - **Months after earning activity**: Points expire after a defined number of months. You can further round up the expiration to a selected period.
    - **Expiration day and month**: Points expire at a specific day of a selected month.

    ### Earning rules

    <Info>
        
        Read [Earning rules](/build/earning-rules) to learn how specific earning rules work.

    </Info>

    **Create earning rule** to define how customers receive loyalty points.

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Details">

        Start by defining overall earning rule settings:
        1. Select earning rule type:
            - **Order has been paid**
            - **Custom event**
            - **Entered segment**
            - **Tier events**
        2. **Name** your earning rule.
        3. Set up start and expiration date (when customers will be able to earn points and until what date) and other time limitations. These settings work the same as for campaign **Time frame**.
        4. Define settings specific for the earning  rule type:
            - **Custom event**: Select or create **Custom event**.
            - **Entered segment**: Select or create **Customer segment**.
            - **Tier events**: Select loyalty tier event and define if these events should trigger for any tier or a specific tier. The loyalty tier can belong to another loyalty program.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Points">

        Define how many points are earned for a given earning rule type.

        <Tabs>

            <Tab title="Order has been paid">

                Set the following:
                1. Select:
                    - **Fixed**: Defines a specific number of points customers will earn for a completed order.
                    - **Proportional**: Defines the rules that will scale the number of earned points with a given condition.
                2. **Enable pending points**: Defines the number of days after the completed order when the customers will receive their points.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Custom event">

            Set the following:
            - **Fixed**: Defines a specific number of points customers will earn when the custom event occurs.
            - **Proportional**: Defines the rules that will scale the number of earned points with a given metadata condition.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Entered segment">

            Set the following:
            - **Fixed**: Defines a specific number of points customers will earn when the customer enters the segment.
            - **Proportional**: Defines the rules that will scale the number of earned points with a given metadata condition.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Tier events">

            Set the **Fixed** number of points customers will earn when the selected loyalty tier event occurs.

            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Additionally, you can set up:
        - **Dynamic formula** to assign a dynamic point value that's calculated with mathematical and logical operators.
        - **Expiration rules** for individual earning rules. These rule-level settings override the campaign-level expiration.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Validation rule (optional)">
        
        Optionally, select a validation rule to define additional limits for your customers that will be checked before triggering points.

        You can:
        - Select an existing rule.
        - Edit an existing rule.
        - Clone and edit an existing rule.
        - Create a new rule.

        <ValRule/>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Metadata">

        Optionally, add metadata to the earning rule.

        You can:
        - Add value to a key from an existing metadata schema.
        - **Add unknown property**: Add a custom attribute that's not defined in the metadata schema.
        - **Add to schema**: Define a new custom attribute and add it to the metadata schema. You can then add value to that metadata.

        For each metadata, you can set **Value type** as:
        - **Undefined**: No value is set and the metadata isn't added to the earning rule.
        - **Null**: The value is set to `null`, for example `"test_metadata": null`.
        - **Value**: Add value according to the metadata type (string, date, boolean, and so on).

        <NoteMetadata/>

    </Step>

    </Steps>

    You can set up many earning rules for one campaign.
    
    <Warning>

    A project can have up to 100 loyalty earning rules. This limit can be increased for users with a single-tenant setup. Contact your technical account manager or [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support).

    </Warning>

## Tiers (optional)

 <Info>

        Read [Loyalty tiers](/build/loyalty-tiers) to learn more about how tiers work.

</Info>


Tiers are optional membership levels of your loyalty campaign. Define loyalty tiers as follows.

    <Steps>

        <Step title="Tier qualification">
            
        There are two ways for customers to qualify to a tier.

        <Tabs>
            <Tab title="Point balance">
            
                Customers qualify for the tier **immediately** if their point balance is in the point range of the tier. This means that they enter the tier if they reach the lower value or drop out of a higher tier and have a value lower than the upper limit. Customers drop out of a tier if their point balance is outside of the range, either if their point balance is lower or higher than the defined limits.

                Customers can drop out of a tier as follows:
                - **Immediately**: Set this to move customers to a lower tier when their point balance is below the lower limit.
                - **Custom**: Set **Value** in months to allow customers to have grace period when they're still in the higher tier. Additionally, you can round up the expiration date.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Points collected in a period">
                
                Customers qualify for the tier if they collect enough points in a given period.

                Define:
                1. **Tier qualification period**: Time when customers need to collect points (for example, calendar month).
                2. **Tier start date**:
                    - **Immediately**: When the tier threshold is reached, the customer is immediately upgraded to the tier.
                    - **Next qualification period**: When the tier threshold is reached, the customer is upgraded to the tier from the subsequent qualification period start date.
                3. **Tier expiration date**:
                    - **End of the qualification period**: The tier will be valid till the end of the qualification period in which the tier was granted.
                    - **End of the next qualification period**: The tier will be valid till the end of the next qualification period in which the tier was granted.
                4. Optionally, **Extend expiration date** by a set value of months or days.


            </Tab>

        </Tabs>


        </Step>

        <Step title="Add tiers">

            **Create tier** to define a loyalty tier:
            1. Enter **Tier name**.
            2. Set **Min. points** to define the lower threshold.
            3. Optionally, set **Max. points** to define the upper threshold for multi-tier loyalty programs.
            4. Optionally, add **Metadata**.

        </Step>

        <Step title="Map earning rules">

            Optionally, you can change the way points are assigned in a specific tier in relation to an earning rule. The point assignments defined with mapping will be made only for members in the particular tier

            **Add mapping** and:
            1. Select **Tier**.
            2. Set **Multiply** and define the **Multiplier**.
            3. Alternatively, set **Custom** to replace the default point value set by the earning rule.
            4. **Save** to add mapping.

            You can map many tiers to an earning rule.

        </Step>

        <Step title="Map rewards">

            Optionally, you can change the price in points for a reward when customers belong to a specific tier.

            **Add mapping** and:
            1. Select **Tier**.
            2. Set **Multiply** and define the **Multiplier**.
            3. Alternatively, set **Custom** to replace the default point value set for the reward.
            4. Alternatively, set **Not available** to turn off a reward for a particular tier
            5. **Save** to add mapping.

            You can map many tiers to a reward.

        </Step>

    </Steps>

    **Add distribution** and select the event that will send the messages:
    - **Reward redeemed**: The message is sent when a customer redeems a reward.
    - **Successfully published**: The message is sent when a voucher is successfully published (assigned) to a customer.
    - **Customer rewarded loyalty points**: The message is sent when a customer earns points in the loyalty program.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    In the distribution builder, **Name** the distribution.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    Go to **Channels** and **Add channel** that will distribute the messages.

    The available channels differ depending on the selected distribution event.

    You can set up many channels for one distribution.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    In **Summary**, check if the distribution configuration is correct.
    
    **Save** to add the distribution to the loyalty campaign.

The loyalty campaign builder guides you through the following steps to launch your program.

<Steps>

<Step>

    ## Campaign details

    <CampDetails />
    3. (Optional) Provide a **Description** for internal reference.
    4. (Optional) Set **New customers will auto-join campaign once any earning rule is fulfilled** for 

    <TimeFrame/>
    - Set **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to ensure that vouchers expire in a defined time after they were assigned to a customer.

    Set **Loyalty card count** to generate a given number of loyalty cards when the campaign is created.

</Step>

<Step>

    ## Point expiration and earning rules

    Set expiration rules for points to determine if customers have a limited time to use their points. Also, set earning rules to define when and under what conditions customers get loyalty points.

    ### Point expiration rules

    Point expiration can be set globally at the campaign level — all points earned through earning rules will follow the same expiration rule.

    You can set the following point expiration rules:
    - **No expiration**: Points never expire. Customers have unlimited time to redeem points for rewards.
    - **Months after earning activity**: Points expire after a defined number of months. You can further round up the expiration to a selected period.
    - **Expiration day and month**: Points expire at a specific day of a selected month.

    ### Earning rules

    <Note>
        
        Read [Earning rules](!!) to learn how specific earning rules work.

    </Note>

    **Create earning rule** to define how customers receive loyalty points.

    <Steps>
    <Step title="Details">

        Start by defining overall earning rule settings:
        1. Select earning rule type:
            - **Order has been paid**
            - **Custom event**
            - **Entered segment**
            - **Tier events**
        2. Name your earning rule.
        3. Set up start and expiration date (when customers will be able to earn points and until what date) and other time limitations. These settings work the same as for campaign **Time frame**.
        4. Define settings specific for the earning  rule type:
            - **Custom event**: Select or create **Custom event**.
            - **Entered segment**: Select or create **Customer segment**.
            - **Tier events**: Select loyalty tier event and define if these events should trigger for any tier or a specific tier. The loyalty tier can belong to another loyalty program.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Points">

        Define how many points are earned for a given earning rule type.

        <Tabs>

            <Tab title="Order has been paid">

                Set the following:
                1. Select:
                    - **Fixed**: Defines a specific number of points customers will earn for a completed order.
                    - **Proportional**: Defines the rules that will scale the number of earned points with a given condition.
                2. **Enable pending points**: Defines the number of days after the completed order when the customers will receive their points.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Custom event">

            Set the following:
            - **Fixed**: Defines a specific number of points customers will earn when the custom event occurs.
            - **Proportional**: Defines the rules that will scale the number of earned points with a given metadata condition.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Entered segment">

            Set the following:
            - **Fixed**: Defines a specific number of points customers will earn when the customer enters the segment.
            - **Proportional**: Defines the rules that will scale the number of earned points with a given metadata condition.

            </Tab>

            <Tab title="Tier events">

            Set the **Fixed** number of points customers will earn when the selected loyalty tier event occurs.

            </Tab>

        </Tabs>

        Additionally, you can set up:
        - **Dynamic formula** to assign a dynamic point value that's calculated with mathematical and logical operators.
        - **Expiration rules** for individual earning rules. These rule-level settings override the campaign-level expiration.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Validation rule (optional)">
        
        Optionally, select a validation rule to define additional limits for your customers that will be checked before triggering points.

        You can:
        - Select an existing rule.
        - Edit an existing rule.
        - Clone and edit an existing rule.
        - Create a new rule.

        <ValRule/>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Metadata">

        Optionally, add metadata to the earning rule.

        You can:
        - Add value to a key from an existing metadata schema.
        - **Add unknown property**: Add a custom attribute that's not defined in the metadata schema.
        - **Add to schema**: Define a new custom attribute and add it to the metadata schema. You can then add value to that metadata.

        For each metadata, you can set **Value type** as:
        - **Undefined**: No value is set and the metadata isn't added to the earning rule.
        - **Null**: The value is set to `null`, for example `"test_metadata": null`.
        - **Value**: Add value according to the metadata type (string, date, boolean, and so on).

        <NoteMetadata/>

    </Step>

    </Steps>

    You can set up many earning rules for one campaign.
    
    <Note>

    A project can have up to 100 loyalty earning rules. This limit can be increased for users with a single-tenant setup. Contact your technical account manager or [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support).

    </Note>

Referral programs allow you to leverage your existing customer base to acquire new users. This reference article explains the underlying logic of single- and double-sided referral programs, conversion tracking, and rewarding architectures in Voucherify.

Use this document as **background and conceptual material** to understand how referral campaigns work under the hood, independently of UI configuration steps.

## Glossary

This glossary explains referral-specific terms used throughout referral workflows.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Referrer">
    The existing customer who owns a unique referral code and shares it with others. Referrers cannot redeem their own codes and earn rewards when invited customers successfully convert.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referee">
    A new customer invited by a referrer. A customer becomes a referee once they perform the defined conversion event associated with a referral code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conversion event">
    The action that marks a referral as successful and converts an invited customer into a referee. A conversion event can be a referral code redemption or a custom event sent via the API. Once Voucherify recognizes the conversion event, the referrer is credited with a successful referral.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referral tier">
    A level within a referral program that defines when and how a referrer is rewarded. Referral tiers enable milestone-based and multi-level rewarding schemas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Publication">
    The technical process of assigning a unique referral code to a specific customer (the referrer). Publication establishes ownership of the code and enables referral tracking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Referral link">
    A URL containing a referral code variable that directs new customers to a signup, checkout, or onboarding flow while preserving referrer attribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Program types

You configure the incentive structure of a referral campaign in the **campaign manager** under the incentive workflow.

### Single-sided program

Rewards are issued only to the referrer. The referee does not receive an incentive for joining.

This model works well for products with strong brand equity, where the act of inviting itself is valuable.

### Double-sided program

Rewards are issued to both the referrer and the referee.

This is the most common referral model and typically delivers higher conversion rates by providing an immediate incentive for new customers.

## Conversion events

The conversion event acts as the **primary trigger** that tells Voucherify a referral was successful. Each referral campaign can have **only one** conversion event type.

### Referral code redemption

The invited customer (referee) redeems the referrer's code during checkout.

**Logic**
- Successful redemption equals a successful referral.

**Referee reward**
- If the referee reward is a discount, it is applied immediately to the transaction.

**Referrer reward**
- Triggered automatically after the referee’s redemption is confirmed.

### Custom event

The conversion is triggered by an API call representing a specific customer action (for example, <code>trial_started</code> or <code>subscription_paid</code>).

**Logic**
- Voucherify records a successful referral when it receives the predefined custom event associated with a referral code.

**Best practice**
- Use custom events when rewards should be granted only after downstream actions such as successful KYC verification or payment confirmation.

## Reward structure

Referral campaigns support separate reward models for referees and referrers.

### Referee rewards (double-sided programs)

In double-sided programs, you define what the new customer receives upon conversion:

- **Discount coupons** – applied at redemption (amount, percentage, free shipping)
- **Gift credits** – balance added to a gift card
- **Loyalty points** – points added to a loyalty card

### Referrer rewards (tiers)

Referrer rewards are managed through **referral tiers**, enabling milestone-based rewarding.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Each unique referee redemption" icon="arrow-right">
    Reward the referrer after every successful referral (for example, $10 per invited friend).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Minimum unique referee redemptions" icon="trophy">
    Grant a higher-value reward after a specific number of referrals (for example, a free month after five referrals).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Referral workflow mechanics

While frontend implementations may vary, the backend referral workflow remains consistent.

### Inviting referrers (publication)

Before a customer can refer others, they must be assigned a referral code through publication.

Publication methods include:
- automatic publication (for example, after joining a segment or completing a purchase)
- manual publication via the dashboard
- on-demand publication through widgets or API-based flows

### Conversion and rewarding flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event detection">
    A referee performs the conversion event (referral code redemption or custom event).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validation">
    Voucherify evaluates validation rules, such as whether the referee is a new customer or whether order conditions are met.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Referee fulfillment">
    If valid, the referee receives their reward (for example, a discount applied to the cart or points added).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Referrer fulfillment">
    Voucherify increments the referrer’s referral count. If a tier threshold is reached, the referrer’s reward is published and delivered through the configured distribution channels.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance monitoring

Voucherify provides real-time metrics for every referral campaign, including:

- **Top referrers** – identify your most influential advocates
- **Conversion rate** – compare code publications to successful conversion events
- **Reward redemptions** – track the total cost of rewards issued to both referees and referrers

<Note>
Use metadata to tag referral codes with attributes such as <code>source: "mobile_app"</code> to analyze which acquisition channels perform best.

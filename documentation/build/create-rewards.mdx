Use rewards to incentivize customers in loyalty and referral campaigns. Voucherify supports three reward categories:

- **Digital rewards**: Discount coupons, gift card credits, or loyalty points delivered automatically to customers.
- **Material rewards**: Physical products from your catalog that require manual fulfillment.
- **Pay with points**: Allows customers to exchange loyalty points for cash value on their orders.

You can create rewards in the dashboard or [upload them via API](https://docs.voucherify.io/reference/create-reward).

## Digital rewards

Digital rewards are delivered automatically when customers redeem them. To create digital rewards, you need existing campaigns that serve as the source of codes.

### Discount coupons

Discount coupons reward customers with:
- Order discounts
- Product discounts
- Free shipping
- Bundles

<Steps>

<Step title="Create source campaign">

[Create a discount coupon campaign](/build/create-discount-coupons) with bulk codes that defines the discount type and value.

</Step>

<Step title="Map campaign to reward">

When creating the reward, select this campaign as the source of reward codes. Each time a customer earns the reward, a new discount coupon from the campaign is published (assigned) to them.

</Step>

</Steps>

<Tip>

You can create a discount campaign directly from the reward builder. Click the **+** button next to **Select campaign** to open a simplified campaign wizard.

</Tip>

### Gift card credits

Gift card credits add balance to a customer's gift card.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create source campaign">

[Create a gift card campaign](/build/create-gift-cards) that serves as the source of gift card codes. Set the initial balance to 0 if you want the reward credits to be the sole balance on the cards.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure reward">

When creating the reward:
1. Set the **Amount** (balance added to the card).
2. Select the **Campaign** as the source of gift card codes.

</Step>

</Steps>

When triggered, the reward publishes a gift card from the campaign to the customer and adds the predefined credits.

### Loyalty points

Loyalty points reward customers by adding points to their loyalty cards. If a customer doesn't have a loyalty card yet, triggering the reward automatically publishes a new card and adds points.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create loyalty program">

[Create a loyalty program](/build/create-loyalty-campaign) first. The reward will add points to cards from this campaign.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure reward">

When creating the reward, select the loyalty campaign and define the number of points to add.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Material rewards

Material rewards are physical products from your catalog. You must [upload your products](https://support.voucherify.io/article/52-product-management) to the dashboard before using them as rewards.

When creating a material reward, you can define:
- **Stock quantity**: The total number of items available for all customers in the campaign.
- **Description**: Text displayed to customers.
- **Image**: Visual representation for customer-facing interfaces.

### Fulfillment workflow

Material rewards require manual confirmation:

1. When a customer redeems a material reward, the status changes to **PENDING**.
2. After you physically deliver the reward, confirm it in the dashboard.
3. Go to the campaign's **Reward redemptions** tab and click the check mark to change the status to **COMPLETE**.

## Pay with points

Pay with points allows customers to use loyalty points to pay for orders. Define the exchange ratio by mapping the number of points to a cash amount.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create pay-with-points reward">

Create a new reward and select **Pay with points** as the reward type.

</Step>

<Step title="Define exchange rate">

Set the conversion between loyalty points and cash value (for example, 100 points = $10).

</Step>

<Step title="Add to loyalty campaign">

Add the pay-with-points reward to your loyalty campaign to enable this option for customers.

</Step>

</Steps>

### Validation rules for pay with points

You can limit pay-with-points redemptions using validation rules. These rules create limits based on customer, order, and metadata attributes.

To add a validation rule:
1. Open the reward in the **Reward catalog** in the **Campaign Manager**.
2. Click the **+** button to open the rule builder.
3. Create or select a validation rule.

If you need to share codes from other sources with Voucherify, you can handle this scenario using the **Import CSV** tool in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import:
- Generic coupons
- New unique coupons to a campaign.
- Existing coupons to update them.

## Preparing CSV file for generic coupons

Use these fields when importing **standalone (generic) discount coupons**. Generic coupons are not assigned to a campaign and work independently.

### Required fields
- **Code**  
  A unique discount coupon code.  
  You cannot import two identical codes into a single Voucherify project.

- **Voucher Type**  
  Defines the voucher type.  
  For discount coupons, the value must be `DISCOUNT_VOUCHER`.

- **Value**  
  The discount value.  
  Must be provided as an integer number.  

- **Discount Type**  
  Defines how the discount value is interpreted.  
  Supported values:
  - `AMOUNT` – fixed amount discount
  - `PERCENT` – percentage discount
  - `FIXED` – fixed price
  - `UNIT` – discount applied per item unit

### Optional fields

- **Discount effect**  
  Defines how the discount is applied to the order.  
  Supported values:
  - `APPLY_TO_ORDER` – applies the discount to the entire order total
  - `APPLY_TO_ITEMS` – applies the discount to selected items only
  - `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY` – distributes the discount proportionally across item values
  - `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY_BY_QUANTITY` – distributes the discount proportionally based on item quantities
  - `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_BY_QUANTITY` – applies the discount to a specific number of eligible items

<Warning>
  For effects that contain `_ITEMS_`, a validation rule is required.  
  Without a validation rule, the discount will not be applied to products.
</Warning>
- **Validation rule ID**  
  The ID of a validation rule that governs how and when the coupon can be redeemed.  
  The rule is automatically applied to the imported coupon.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the coupon.  
  Categories help you filter and organize coupons in the Dashboard.

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the coupon.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.  
  An inactive coupon cannot be redeemed, even if it is within its validity timeframe.

- **Start date**  
  The date when the coupon becomes valid.  
  It must follow the ISO 8601 format, for example: `2022-09-19T00:00:00.000Z`.

- **Expiration date**  
  The date when the coupon expires.  
  It must follow the ISO 8601 format, for example: `2022-11-30T00:00:00.000Z`.

- **Redeemed quantity**  
  The number of times the coupon has already been redeemed.  
  If omitted, the value defaults to `0`.

- **Redeemed amount**  
  The total discount amount already redeemed using this coupon.

- **Redemption limit**  
  The maximum number of redemptions allowed.  
  If omitted, the redemption limit is set to unlimited.

- **Additional info**  
  Any additional information you want to store with the coupon.  
  This field is informational only.

- **Formula**  
  A dynamic discount formula applied to the coupon.  
  Provide the *Expression Output* of an existing formula.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

These codes will function as standalone discount coupons, independent of a campaign. 

### Import generic coupons

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** and **Import CSV**.

## Preparing CSV file for campaign discount coupons

<Info>

If you don't have a campaign for your codes yet, [create a discount coupon campaign](/build/create-discount-coupons) first.

</Info>

Use these fields when importing discount coupons **into an existing campaign**.  
Imported coupons inherit all campaign settings unless explicitly overridden.

### Required fields

- **Code**  
  A unique discount coupon code.

### Optional fields

- **Active**  
  Enables or disables the coupon.  
  Accepted values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

  Import behavior:
  - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted, imported coupons are set to `TRUE`.
  - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted, imported coupons are set to `FALSE`.

- **Category**  
  A custom tag assigned to the coupon for filtering and organization.

- **Redeemed quantity**  
  The number of times the coupon has already been redeemed.

- **Start date**  
  The date when the coupon becomes valid.  
  Must follow the ISO 8601 format.

- **Expiration date**  
  The date when the coupon expires.  
  Must follow the ISO 8601 format.

- **Metadata (custom attributes)**  

<MetadataImport/>

  Metadata import behavior:
  - If metadata columns are omitted, the coupon inherits the campaign’s metadata.
  - If metadata columns are added and mapped, only those specific fields are overridden.
  - Metadata that is not mapped remains unchanged.

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

<a href="/examples/import-discount-coupons-into-campaign-template.csv" download>CSV discount coupon file template</a>

</Note>

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings as well as validation rules, time frame, redemption limits, and so on.

### Import discount coupons to a campaign

In **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns**, go to the discount campaign where you want to import the coupons. In the top right corner, use the three-dot menu to **Import CSV file**.

<VoucherImport/>

New discount coupons will be visible in the **Vouchers** tab in the detailed campaign view.

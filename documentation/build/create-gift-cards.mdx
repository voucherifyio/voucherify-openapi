Gift cards act as digital wallets that store customer credits and can be used for purchases. You can create a new gift card campaign using the **Campaign Manager** in the Voucherify dashboard.

## Campaign details

<Note>

**Code generation settings** can be defined only for **Bulk codes**. For gift cards, it is best practice to use **Bulk codes** for security, as they represent stored monetary value.

In the discount builder, you can also set up additional conditions like validation rules to limit the discount behavior (for example, only orders above $100).

## Gift Card Management and Usage

Voucherify automatically updates the gift card balance each time it is redeemed.

### Partial Redemption

The gift card value does not have to be used in one order. If you allow partial redemption, a customer can choose to use only a portion of the card's balance and save the rest for later.

* **Default Behavior**: If you use the `Redemption` API call without specifying the amount, Voucherify uses the entire balance to pay for the order. The remaining balance is available for future orders if the order value is less than the card balance.
* **Custom Redemption**: You can specify the exact amount of credits used in the `Redemption` API call to control how much money is taken out of the card’s balance.

### Manage Gift Card Balance

You can monitor the current balance in the gift card details and load new credits anytime.

* **Add balance in the Dashboard**: Go to the detailed view of a gift card and add the proper amount to the current balance by clicking on the dollar icon (**$**).
* **Add balance with API**: Use the `Adjust Voucher Balance API` by including the gift card code and the amount to quickly add credits to the gift card.

## Tracking and Reporting

Voucherify tracks your gift cards on many levels and presents stored data in the dashboard.

### Overview Reports

* **Main project view**: Provides a chart presenting overall gift voucher spending.
* **Campaigns view**: Shows a list of campaigns, including the already redeemed amount and the amount left on gift cards. When you click on the campaign name, you will see a redemption summary, recent campaign changes, and budget management. You can also export campaign data to a CSV file from this view.

### Voucher Tab

The **Voucher** tab is the central hub for managing all gift card-related activities.

<CardGroup cols={2}>

Each gift card is listed with its unique code. Clicking the code shows details including:
* Credit balance, subtracted credits, and lifetime credits.
* Gift effect, campaign, owner, and category.
* Redemption limit and additional info.
</Card>

<Card title="Actions and Filters" icon="settings">
* **Filtering**: Use filters at the top left corner to narrow down gift cards based on selected criteria.
* **Status**: You can change the gift card's status (Active/Disabled) using the toggle next to the three-dot menu (**⋮**).
* **Additional Actions**: Click the three-dot menu (**⋮**) on the right side to:
    * Publish the gift card.
    * Edit or delete the gift card.
    * Display QR code or barcode.

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Detailed Tracking Tabs

* **Redemption history tab**: Review all redemption events linked to the gift card campaign to track usage and customer activity over time. You can filter results, export the redemption log, and see details like the redemption status, ID, incentive, and customer.

* **Transactions tab**: Located within the **General** section of the Gift Card campaign dashboard, this tab lists all gift card transactions. Each entry includes:
    * **Card, Type, and Source ID**.
    * **Reason, Amount, and Balance** after the transaction.
    * **Details** containing API response specifics for auditing and simplified reporting.

<Tip>
Voucherify only offers digital gift cards that act as gift card codes. If you need to create a physical gift card, refer to the [related guide](https://support.voucherify.io/article/169-how-to-create-printable-vouchers-and-gift-cards).

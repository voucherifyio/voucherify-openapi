Gift cards act as digital wallets that store customer credits and can be used for purchases. You can create a new gift card campaign using the **Campaign Manager** in the Voucherify dashboard.

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** to **Create campaign** and select **Gift vouchers**.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Campaign details

<CampDetails />

3. Optionally, provide a **Description** for internal reference.

<CampSize/>

<Note>

- **Code generation settings** can only be defined for **Bulk codes**. For gift cards, it's best to use **Bulk codes** for security, as they represent stored monetary value.
- **Redemption limit** is set to **Unlimited** by default.

</Note>

</Step>

<Step>

## Time frame

<TimeFrame/>

- **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to ensure that gift cards expire in a defined time after they were assigned to a customer.

</Step>

<Step>

## Gift credits value

Configure the monetary value and how the gift card will be applied to the customer's purchase:
1. **Initial amount**: Define the initial monetary value loaded onto each card.
2. **Apply credits to**: Determine how the gift card will be applied.
    - **Whole cart**: The credits can lower the price of the whole order.
    - **Items**: Select products or collections that can be covered with the gift credits. You can also select **Excluded products** that won't be covered by the credits.

For **Items**, you can additionally configure:
- **Application rules**: Defines how the discount is spread across applicable order lines.
- **Capped by**: Limits the number of items to which the discount can be applied.

<Note>

For detailed descriptions of **Application rules** and **Capped by**, refer to the Complete Discounts Guide.

</Note>

You can set additional conditions using **Validation rules** to limit the gift card's behavior (for example, only allow redemption for orders above $100).

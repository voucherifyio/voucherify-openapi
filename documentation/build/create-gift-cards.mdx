Gift cards act as digital wallets that store customer credits and can be used for purchases. You can create a new gift card campaign using the **Campaign Manager** in the Voucherify dashboard.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Campaign details

<CampDetails />

3. (Optional) Provide a **Description** for internal reference.

<Badge color="blue">Important notes</Badge>

**Code generation settings** can only be defined for **Bulk codes**. For gift cards, it is best practice to use **Bulk codes** for security, as they represent stored monetary value.

</Note>

</Step>

<Step>

## Time frame

<TimeFrame/>

- Set **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to ensure that gift cards expire in a defined time after they were assigned to a customer.

</Step>

<Step>

## Gift credits value

Here, you configure the monetary value and how the gift card will be applied to the customer's purchase.

* **Initial amount**: Define the initial monetary value loaded onto each card.
* **Apply credits to**: Determine how the gift card will be applied: to the **Whole cart** or only to **Specific items**.

In the same section, you can configure:

* **Application rules**: Limits the discount amount (e.g., maximum gift card amount that can be used).
* **Capped by**: Limits the number of items to which the discount can be applied.

<Note>

For detailed descriptions of **Application rules** and **Capped by**, refer to the Complete Discounts Guide.

</Note>

You can set additional conditions using **Validation Rules** to limit the gift card's behavior (for example, only allow redemption for orders above $100).

<Note>

Read Create validation rules to learn how to set the rules.

Read Validation rules for a detailed description of all validation rules and other settings.

Loyalty tiers are optional membership levels within your loyalty program. They divide your program based on a customer's status, typically tied to their point balance or points collected over time.

Each tier can have unique rules for both earning points and redeeming rewards, allowing you to offer premium benefits to your most engaged customers.

## Tier structure and overview

| Tier property | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Membership level** | Unlimited number of tiers supported per campaign. | Basic, Silver, Gold, Platinum. |
| **Qualification method** | Determined by either **points balance** or **points collected in a period**. | Points balance (100 – 499 points). |
| **Earning rules mapping** | Each tier can define point multipliers to increase or decrease earned points per rule. | 2x points for Gold tier members. |
| **Rewards mapping** | Each tier can define multipliers or custom values for reward point prices. | Reward X costs 50% fewer points for Gold tier members. |

## Qualification by points balance

Qualification is based on a customer's current, spendable point balance falling within the tier's defined minimum and maximum point range.

### Tier status logic

| System event | Default behavior (continuous check) | Custom expiration option |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier entry** | Immediate upgrade when balance reaches minimum threshold. | Counter starts, running for the specified months, **after reaching minimum required points**. |
| **Tier exit** | Immediate downgrade when balance falls below minimum range. | Tier remains valid for a defined period (months) even if the balance falls out of range. |
| **Verification** | Real-time balance check. | Verified upon tier expiration: **prolonged** if balance is sufficient, **downgraded** if insufficient. |

<Warning>

The **auto-redeem** feature operates before loyalty tier checks are performed. This creates a conflict for **balance-based tiers** and may prevent the customer from meeting the tier's qualification threshold.

</Warning>

### Expiration period rounding

The expiration period, defined as a number of months, can be rounded up until the end of a selected period (e.g., end of a calendar month, quarter, year).

## Qualification by points collected in a period

Qualification requires the sum of points collected within a specific time period to reach the tier threshold.

<Note>

Qualification is based on **collected points** (earned) rather than current balance. Therefore, **auto-redeem does not interfere** with these tiers.

</Note>

### Qualification periods

* **Calendar month**
* **Calendar quarter**
* **Calendar half-year**
* **Calendar year**

### Tier start and expiration logic

The resulting tier status is determined by the combination of the start date and expiration date configurations:

| Configuration parameter | Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier start date** | **Immediately** | Tier starts immediately when the threshold is reached. |
| | **Next calendar month** | Tier start is postponed until the beginning of the subsequent qualification period. |
| **Tier expiration date** | **End of the qualification period** | Tier is valid till the end of the period in which it was granted. |
| | **End of the next calendar month** | Tier is valid till the end of the following period after it was granted. |

#### Grace period

A **grace period** can be added to the tier expiration date with 'extend expiration date by' option, extending the validity period in days or months to delay downgrades.

## Tier-specific rules and rewards mapping

Tiers define configuration overrides for the default points values of program rules:

* **Earning rules mapping:** Defines point **multipliers** that increase or decrease the number of earned points per rule.
* **Rewards mapping:** Defines **multipliers** or **custom values** that set new reward point prices for tier members.
    * Rewards can be disabled for a tier using the **Not available** option.

## Tier campaign modification rules

It is possible to implement changes to an existing campaign's qualification rules or tier structure.

<Warning>

**Recommendation:** Changes to **qualification rules** and **tiers structure** should be performed in **sequential, separate campaign modification steps**. Two asynchronous tasks might be scheduled otherwise, leading to potential discrepancies in customer tiers updates.

</Warning>

### Qualification rules changes

Qualification rules changes are triggered by selecting the **refresh tiers** option in the Tiers step under the expiration options when editing a campaign.

| Option selected | Customer tier result (upon save) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Without the ‘Refresh tiers’ option selected** | Tiers are **not changed**; no upgrades or downgrades occur. |
| **With the ‘Refresh tiers’ option selected** | Tiers **may be refreshed**: potential tier **upgrades** and expiration date updates (shortened or extended) may occur. There will be **no downgrades**. |

### Tier structure changes (thresholds)

Tier structure changes involve adding new tiers or modifying existing points thresholds.

| Structure change | Customer status | Customer tier result (upon save) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adding/changing thresholds** | Tiers without expiration dates | Tiers are updated with potential **upgrades and downgrades**. |
| | Tiers with expiration dates | Customers **will not be downgraded** but **may be upgraded**. |
| **Removing tier(s)** | All customers | Customers **lose** the removed tier(s). |

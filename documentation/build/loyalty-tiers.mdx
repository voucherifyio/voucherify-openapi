## Qualification by Point balance

The **Point balance** method qualifies customers based on their current, spendable point balance falling within the tier's defined minimum and maximum point range.

### Point balance – tier status logic

The **Point balance** tiers work as follows:
- Tier entry:
    - **Immediately** (default behavior): The customer's tier is immediately upgraded when their point balance reaches the minimum threshold.
- Tier exit:
    - **Immediately** (default behavior): The customer's tier is immediately downgraded when the balance falls below the minimum range.
    - **Custom**: The tier remains valid for a defined period (months), even if the customer's balance falls out of the range. The expiration date counter starts when the customer reaches the minimum required points needed in the tier. Additionally, you can round up the expiration period until the end of a selected period (for example, end of a calendar month, quarter, year).

<Warning>

The <Tooltip headline="Auto-redeem" tip="A reward is automatically redeemed when the customer reaches the defined number of loyalty points.">auto-redeem</Tooltip> feature operates before loyalty tier checks are performed. This creates a conflict for **Point balance** tiers and may prevent the customer from meeting the tier's qualification threshold.

</Warning>

## Qualification by Points collected in a period

The **Points collected in a period** method qualifies the customer when they earn a defined number of points to reach the tier threshold within a specific time period.

<Note>

Qualification is based on **collected points** (earned) rather than the current balance. As a result, **auto-redeem** does not interfere with these tiers.

</Note>

### Qualification periods

The customers can earn points with **Points collected in a period** in the following time ranges:
- **Calendar month**: Points collected in one calendar month (January, February, and so on).
- **Calendar quarter**: Points collected in a quarter (from January until March, from April until June, and so on).
- **Calendar half-year**: Points collected in the half-year (from January until June and from July until December).
- **Calendar year**: Points collected in one calendar year (from January until December).

### Points collected in a period – tier status logic

The resulting tier status is determined by the combination of the start date and expiration date configurations:
- **Tier start date**:
    - **Immediately**: Tier starts immediately when the threshold is reached.
        - Example: For monthly qualification periods, the customer collects a required number of points on the 10th day of the month and the tier will start from that day.
    - **Next calendar month**: Tier start is postponed until the beginning of the subsequent qualification period.
        - Example: For monthly qualification periods, the customer collects a required number of points on the 10th day of the month (for example, March), the tier will start from the 1st day of the following month (April).
- **Tier expiration date**:
    - **End of the qualification period**: Tier is valid until the end of the period in which it was granted.
        - Example: For monthly qualification periods, the tier will be valid until the end of the month it was granted (for example from 10th March until 31st March).
    - **End of the next calendar month**: Tier is valid until the end of the following period after it was granted.
        - Example: For monthly qualification periods, the tier will be valid until the end of the following month based on the month the tier was granted (for example from 10th March until 30 April).
    - **Extend expiration date by**: You can add a grace period the tier expiration date with to extend the time in days or months to delay tier downgrades.
        - Example: For monthly qualification periods, the tier will be valid until the end of the month or the end of the next month in which the tier was granted and defined an additional 7 days period in the extensions. The tier will expire not at the end of the month but on the 7th day of the next month.

## Mapping earning rules and rewards

You can change the number of points given by an earning rule or the reward cost in points depending in the loyalty tier the customer is in:
- **Earning rules mapping**: Defines point **multipliers** that increase or decrease the number of earned points per rule. You can also set a **Custom** number of points to change the default earning rule value.
* **Rewards mapping**: Defines **multipliers** or **custom**  values that set new reward point prices for tier members. A reward can be also disabled for a tier using the **Not available** option.

## Tier campaign modification rules

It is possible to implement changes to an existing campaign's qualification rules or tier structure.

<Warning>

Changes to **qualification rules** and **tiers structure** should be performed in **sequential, separate campaign modification steps**. Two asynchronous tasks might be scheduled otherwise, leading to potential discrepancies in customer tier updates.

</Warning>

### Qualification rules changes

Qualification rules changes are triggered by selecting the **Refresh tiers** option in the Tiers step under the expiration options when editing a campaign:
- Without the **Refresh tiers** option selected: Customer tiers remain unchanged according to the new rules upon campaign save. No tier upgrades or downgrades occur.
- With the **Refresh tiers** option selected: Customer tiers may be refreshed according to the new rules upon campaign save. Tier upgrades may occur, and expiration dates may be shortened or extended, but no downgrades will happen.

### Tier structure changes (thresholds)

Tier structure changes involve adding new tiers or modifying existing points thresholds:
- **Adding new tiers or changing points thresholds**:
  - **Customer tiers without expiration dates**: Tiers are updated according to the new structure upon campaign save. Both tier upgrades and downgrades may happen.
  - **Customer tiers with expiration dates**: Customers will not be downgraded to lower tiers but may be upgraded to higher tiers according to the new structure upon campaign save. Tier upgrades may occur, but no downgrades will happen.
* **Removing tiers**: Customers lose the removed tiers immediately upon campaign save.

Loyalty points serve as the currency of the loyalty program, accumulating on a customer's dedicated loyalty card. They are awarded based on predefined **earning rules** and can be redeemed for rewards defined by **redemption rules**.

## Key point mechanics

### Pending points

Pending points are points that have been earned by a customer but are not yet available for redemption. This status is used to create a mandatory waiting period for points to ensure validity, account for potential returns, or synchronize with external systems.

* **Definition**: Points held in a temporary status after an earning rule has been met.
* **Mechanism**: When configuring an earning rule, a specific **pending period** (in days) can be set.
* **Lifecycle**: Points are instantly applied to the customer's card but remain *pending*. Upon the conclusion of the pending period, they are automatically credited and become available for redemption.

### Expiration rules

Point expiration rules define the duration of a point's validity, ensuring active participation in the loyalty program. These rules are configured globally or per-earning rule.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Fixed expiration (fixed period)">
Points expire after a set amount of time (e.g., 12 months), irrespective of customer activity. The validity timer usually starts immediately upon the points being credited (moving out of the pending state).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rolling expiration (rolling period)">
Expiration is calculated relative to the date the points were earned. For example, points expire on the last day of the month following the earning date (e.g., points earned in May expire on June 30th). This offers flexibility and a shorter, more predictable expiry window.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Activity-based expiration">
Points expire if the customer has been inactive for a defined duration. Inactivity is typically defined as not making a new purchase or not interacting with the loyalty program in a specified manner (e.g., 6 months without earning or redeeming points).

## Advanced loyalty features

### Auto-redeem

Auto-redeem is a mechanism that automatically triggers the conversion of points into a specific reward once a customer reaches a defined point threshold.

* **Function**: Automatically enrolls the customer in a redemption rule.
* **Trigger**: The system monitors the customer's **available points balance**. When the balance reaches or exceeds the pre-set threshold defined in the redemption rule, the reward (e.g., a specific coupon, gift card) is automatically issued to the customer.
* **Goal**: To provide instant, effortless gratification to customers without requiring manual action or intervention.

### Daily Point Calculations

Voucherify processes specific, time-sensitive calculations and checks once every brand new day. This ensures accurate synchronization for expiration and tier structure management.

* **Execution time**: These calculations typically run at midnight (00:00:00) according to the project's configured timezone (often UTC, but configurable).
* **Calculations performed**:
    * **Pending to active**: Points where the **pending period** has just ended are transitioned from the *pending* balance to the *active* (available) balance.
    * **Expiration checks**: Points that reached their **expiration date** are removed from the *active* balance.
    * **Tier status evaluation**: Customer point balances are evaluated against the configured tier structure thresholds (e.g., checking if enough points have been accumulated for an upgrade).

### Loyalty point balance types

A customer's total loyalty standing is composed of several balance metrics:

| Balance type | Description | Availability for redemption |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pending** | Points earned but currently held during the set pending period. | **No** |
| **Active (available)** | Points that have cleared the pending period and are ready to be used. | **Yes** |
| **Redeemed** | Points that have been successfully used by the customer to claim a reward. | **N/A (Used)** |
| **Expired** | Points that have passed their set expiration date or period. | **No** |
| **Total** | The cumulative sum of all points ever earned by the customer (active + pending + redeemed + expired). | **No (Tracking)** |

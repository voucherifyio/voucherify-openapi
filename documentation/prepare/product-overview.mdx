Voucherify is an incentive optimization engine that helps you run discounts and loyalty rules on the right items.

The **Products** section lets you organize your catalog and use product data in campaigns, promotions, and validation rules.

## Core building blocks

Products in Voucherify are based on two key elements:
- **Products** – base items in your catalog  
- **SKUs** – variants of a product (for example size or color)

To work with groups of items, you can use:
- **Product collections**: sets of products defined manually or by filters.

## Why this matters

Many incentives should not apply to every item in the cart.

With products and collections, you can:
- Reward only selected products
- Limit discounts to specific categories
- Build loyalty rules for chosen items
- Control where incentives apply

This helps you stay precise and protect your margins.

## What you can do with products

The **Products** section gives you building blocks for product-based incentives.

You can:
- Add products and SKUs to your catalog
- Enrich items with custom attributes (metadata)
- Group items into collections
- Use collections in validation rules and campaigns

## How products connect to campaigns

Products do not work alone.

They connect with other Voucherify features, such as:
- Validation rules
- Discount promotions
- Loyalty earning rules
- Product-based bundles (like BOGO)

This makes it easier to reuse the same product logic across many campaigns.

<Tip>
    
    Start simple: create one collection and use it in a validation rule to limit where a promotion applies.

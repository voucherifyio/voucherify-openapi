In Voucherify, there are two ways to remove resources: move them to the bin or delete them permanently. When a resource, such as a campaign, product, SKU, or voucher, is moved to the bin, you can't create a new one with the same unique identifiers, like the same source ID or voucher code name.

<Warning>
Items moved to the bin cannot be restored.
</Warning>

## Delete a resource

<Info>

    <Badge color="gray">User permissions</Badge>

    A user must have the following permissions to permanently delete a resource:
    - delete vouchers
    - delete campaigns
    - create and modify products and products collections

</Info>

Click the bin icon to permanently delete an item.

A popup window will appear. It informs that this action is irreversible and that new objects with the same source ID, name, or code can now be created.

<Note>
    
    Campaign deletion can take a significant time depending on the number of vouchers in that campaign.

</Note>

Voucherify uses customer data to help you run targeted promotions, apply validation rules, and track engagement. You can manage your audience by creating individual profiles, synchronizing data from external systems, or performing bulk imports.

To manage customers, go to **Engagement** > **Customers** in your dashboard.

## Customer data

Each customer profile in Voucherify consists of:

- **Standard attributes** such as name, email, phone number, and address.
- **System-generated data** including orders, redemptions, loyalty points, and referrals.
- **Wallet** including discount coupons, gift cards, referral codes, and loyalty cards a given customer currently has.
- **Metadata**, which stores custom attributes used for segmentation, validation rules, personalization, and geofencing.

Understanding this structure is key to modeling customer data correctly and avoiding unintended overwrites.

### Customer identification

Every customer is identified by two unique identifiers:

- **Customer ID**  
  A unique internal identifier assigned automatically by Voucherify.

- **Source ID**  
  A custom identifier from your own system, such as a CRM ID, email address, or phone number.

<Tip>
Use the **Source ID** to keep your external database in sync with Voucherify. When a customer is created or imported with an existing Source ID, Voucherify overwrites the existing profile with the new data.
</Tip>

## Create a customer profile

Customer profiles are created automatically when data is synchronized through API or integrations. You can also add customers manually in the Dashboard. The builder is also used to edit the customer profile.

### Add customer manually

To add a customer manually in the Dashboard go to **Engagement** > **Customers**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open customer builder">
    Use the three-dots menu in the upper-right corner to add a customer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter customer details">
    Provide the following information:
    - **General information**: Name, Source ID, description, birthdate.
    - **Contact details**: Email address and phone number.
    - **Address**: Physical location details.
    - **Metadata**: Custom attributes defined in your Metadata Schema.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A customer profile is added with a unique Voucherify ID.

## Data import and synchronization

Voucherify offers multiple ways to keep customer data up to date across systems.

### CSV import

CSV imports allow you to create new customer profiles or update existing ones in bulk. CSV import file must include the **Customer ID** or **Source ID** and the fields to update.

<Note>
**Import guidelines**:
- **Maximum file size**: 10 MB.
- **Date format**: ISO 8601 (for example, `2022-03-11` or `2022-03-11T09:00:00.000Z`).
- **Headers**: Metadata headers must not contain spaces.
- **Boolean metadata**: Use `true`, `false`, or `null`.
</Note>

<Warning>
When importing customers using **Source ID**, existing profiles with the same Source ID are fully overwritten. This includes standard attributes and metadata.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the file">
    Download the [CSV import template](/examples/import-customers-template.csv) and populate it with customer data using supported field names.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the file">
    In the **Customers** view, click **Import** and upload your CSV file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map attributes">
    Map CSV columns to Voucherify fields. Columns not mapped to standard fields can be imported as metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import">
    Confirm the mapping and click **Import**. You will receive a notification once processing is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Metadata in imports

- Metadata defined in the **Metadata Schema** preserves its data type (number, date, boolean, array).
- Metadata imported without a schema definition is stored as **unknown metadata** and treated as a string.
- Unknown metadata cannot be used for numeric or date-based filtering until it is added to the schema.
- Only non-nested metadata fields are imported correctly.

## Delete customers

You can delete customers using the three-dots actions menu in the dashboard ⋮ at the end of each customer record or through a dedicated API endpoint.

<Warning>
Deleting a customer permanently removes their profile and may impact reporting, redemptions, and loyalty history.
</Warning>

## Export customer data

Export customer data to analyze it in external analytics, BI, or CRM tools.

Go to **Engagement** > **Customers** to **Export** a customer list. You can use filters to narrow down the results.

## Related features

Customers are a core building block in Voucherify. Once customers are created, you can reuse them across segmentation, validation rules, integrations, and API-driven workflows.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Use filters for segments">
  
    Use customer attributes to build [segments](/prepare/customer-segments) that dynamically group customers based on their profile, behavior, or metadata. Segments can then be reused across campaigns, distributions, and analytics to target specific audiences without manual updates.
  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use customers in validation rules">
  
    Customer data can be referenced in **validation rules** to control eligibility for    campaigns and redemptions. For example, you can restrict promotions to new customers, exclude specific customer IDs, or apply rules based on customer metadata.
  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Geofencing">
  
    You can limit promotions and redemptions based on a customer’s location using **geofencing**. This helps control where offers are available and prevents misuse across regions.  
  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer Engagement Platforms and other integrations">
    
    Customers in Voucherify can be used with Customer Engagement Platforms (CEPs) for increased customer engagement and other marketing tools to keep profiles consistent across systems.
  
    Go to [CEP overview](/integrations/customer-engagement-platforms) to explore platforms that can be connected with Voucherify and other integrations.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Developer setup: Customer API">
  
    Developers can manage customers programmatically using the **Customer API**, including:
    - Creating and updating customer profiles
    - Attaching metadata and custom attributes
    - Importing customers in bulk using the API or CSV import
    - Linking customers to vouchers, referral codes, loyalty cards, and gift cards

    To keep customer data synchronized automatically, use the **[Create Customer API](/api-reference/customers/create-customer)** whenever a new user is added to your system.

    This setup is commonly used when Voucherify is integrated directly with your backend or when customer data is managed outside the Dashboard.

Before you launch campaigns, you need the right data in place. The Prepare section covers the building blocks that make your incentives work: customers, products, orders, and metadata.

Use this section to set up and manage the data that drives validation rules, segments, and campaign targeting. Clean, structured data means faster experimentation and better results.

## Why preparation matters

Voucherify validates every redemption against your data. The more complete your customer profiles, product catalog, and order history, the more precise your targeting becomes. Metadata extends this further, letting you build rules around any attribute your business needs.

Well-prepared data enables:

- **Faster campaign launches**: Reuse segments and collections across campaigns.
- **Precise targeting**: Apply discounts to specific products, customer tiers, or order conditions.
- **Scalable experimentation**: Test different audiences and offers without rebuilding data structures.

## What's next?

Start with [customers](/prepare/customers) if you're setting up audience targeting, or [products](/prepare/products) if you're building product-specific promotions. Use [metadata](/prepare/metadata) to extend any resource with custom attributes.

Voucherify campaigns run on data: who your customers are, what they buy, and how you want to categorize them. The Prepare section covers the building blocks you need before launching campaigns.

This data feeds into validation rules, earning rules, distributions, and reporting. The more complete your data, the more precisely you can target incentives and measure results.

## What you can prepare

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Customers" icon="users" href="/prepare/customers">
  Import or sync customer profiles. Use standard fields and metadata to build segments and validation rules.
</Card>

<Card title="Customer segments" icon="users-rectangle" href="/prepare/customer-segments">
  Group customers by attributes, behavior, or metadata. Segments drive distributions, earning rules, and eligibility checks.

  Add products and SKUs to define product-specific discounts, BOGO offers, and validation rules.
</Card>

<Card title="Product collections" icon="boxes-stacked" href="/prepare/product-collections">
  Group products into static or dynamic collections for reuse across campaigns and rules.
</Card>

<Card title="Orders" icon="receipt" href="/prepare/orders">
  Track customer purchases. Order data powers cart-based validation rules and customer activity segments.

## Why this matters

Voucherify is built for experimentation at scale. The data you prepare here becomes the foundation for:

- **Targeted campaigns**: Use segments and metadata to reach the right customers with the right offer.
- **Flexible validation rules**: Control eligibility based on customer attributes, cart contents, or order history.
- **Automated distributions**: Trigger incentives when customers enter segments or meet specific conditions.
- **Accurate reporting**: Track performance by customer group, product category, or custom dimensions.

Clean, well-structured data reduces friction when launching new campaigns and makes it easier to iterate quickly.

## Where to start

If you're setting up a new project or moving to production:

1. **Define your metadata schemas** in [Project settings](/prepare/metadata) before importing data. This ensures consistent data types and enables filtering.
2. **Import customers** via CSV or API. Include source IDs to keep Voucherify in sync with your CRM or CDP.
3. **Add products** if you plan to use product-specific discounts or validation rules.
4. **Create segments** to group customers for distributions and eligibility checks.

<Note>
You can launch campaigns without importing all your data upfront. Voucherify creates customer and product records automatically when they appear in API requests. However, pre-loading data gives you more control over segmentation and validation.

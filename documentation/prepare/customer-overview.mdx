Voucherify uses customer data to help you run targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and validation rules.

The **Customers** section lets you manage individual profiles and organize your audience into segments.

## Core building blocks

Customer logic in Voucherify is based on two main elements:
- **Customer profiles**: Individual records with contact details, activity data, and incentives.
- **Customer segments**: Groups of customers based on shared attributes or behavior. Segments can be static (fixed lists) or dynamic (updated automatically based on filters).

## Why this matters

Not every incentive should be available to every customer.

With customer profiles and segments, you can:
- Reward selected groups of customers
- Limit promotions to specific audiences
- Personalize offers based on profile data
- Control who is eligible for a campaign

This helps you create more relevant experiences and improve campaign performance.

## What you can do

The **Customers** section provides the building blocks for audience-based incentives.

You can:
- Create and manage customer profiles
- Store standard data and custom metadata
- Group customers into segments
- Reuse segments across campaigns and rules

## How customers connect to campaigns

Customers work together with other Voucherify features, such as:
- Validation rules
- Discount promotions
- Loyalty programs
- Distributions and referral programs

This flexible structure lets you reuse the same audience logic across many campaigns and workflows.

<Tip>

    Start simple. Create one segment and use it in a validation rule to control who can use a promotion.

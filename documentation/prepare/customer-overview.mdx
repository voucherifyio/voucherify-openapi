Voucherify uses customer data to help you run targeted promotions, loyalty programs, and validation rules.

The **Customers** section lets you manage individual profiles and organize your audience into segments.

## Why this matters

Not every incentive should be available to every customer.

With customer profiles and segments, you can:

- reward selected groups of customers
- limit promotions to specific audiences
- personalize offers based on profile data
- control who is eligible for a campaign

This helps you create more relevant experiences and improve campaign performance.

## What you can do

The Customers section provides the building blocks for audience-based incentives.

You can:

- create and manage customer profiles
- store standard data and custom metadata
- group customers into segments
- reuse segments across campaigns and rules

## Core building blocks

Customer logic in Voucherify is based on two main elements:

- **Customer profiles** – individual records with contact details, activity data, and incentives
- **Customer segments** – groups of customers based on shared attributes or behavior

Segments can be static (fixed lists) or dynamic (updated automatically based on filters).

## How customers connect to campaigns

Customers work together with other Voucherify features, such as:

- validation rules
- discount promotions
- loyalty programs
- distributions and referral programs

This flexible structure lets you reuse the same audience logic across many campaigns and workflows.

<Tip>
Start simple. Create one segment and use it in a validation rule to control who can use a promotion.

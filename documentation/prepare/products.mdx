In the **Products** section, you can build and manage your product inventory. By defining standard and custom product attributes, you can create specific rules for promotions and loyalty programs.

## Key terms

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Product ID">
A unique internal identifier assigned automatically by Voucherify, for example `prod_09268673c85013482b`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Source ID">
An optional external ID that matches the product identifier used in your own system.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SKU">
A product variant. SKUs inherit metadata from the product but can also have their own attributes.

## Add products

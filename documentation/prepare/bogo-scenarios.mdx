BOGO campaigns reward customers when they buy selected products.

In Voucherify, BOGO is configured using the **Bundles** discount category.  
You define which products must be in the cart (**Buy X**) and which products are rewarded (**Get Y**).

BOGO campaigns are commonly used for:

- buy one, get one free
- buy 2, get 1 free
- buy from one collection, get a gift
- free items with value limits

## Key concepts

- **Buy X**: Products the customer must purchase.
- **Get Y**: Products the customer receives for free.
- **Minimum quantity**: How many items are required to trigger the reward.
- **Item discount limit**: Controls how many reward units are added per bundle.

## BOGO scenarios

Follow these step-by-step examples to configure popular BOGO offers.

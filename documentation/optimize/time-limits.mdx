Use time limits to control when campaigns, vouchers, and promotion tiers are active.

All time-related limits follow the **time zone** defined in your **Project settings**.

<Calendar/>

## Start and expiration dates

These settings define the main period when customers can redeem codes.

Voucherify blocks redemption attempts before the start date and after the expiration date.

### Starts on

This setting defines when the campaign becomes active:
- **Creation**: The campaign starts immediately after you save it.
- **Specific date**: The campaign starts at a chosen date and time.

### Expires

This setting defines when the campaign ends.
- **Never**: The campaign runs until you manually disable it.
- **On specific date**: The campaign ends automatically at the chosen date and time.

## Time limitations

You can add recurring validity windows using the **Add limitation** option.

These limitations work inside the main campaign timeframe.

### Add duration & interval time frame

It allows you to make vouchers or promotions valid for a specific duration at regular intervals.

For example:
- Valid for **1 hour**
- Repeated every **1 day**

The validity window starts based on the campaign start time.

You can combine this limit with **Valid days of the week**.

### Add valid days of the week

It limits redemptions to selected weekdays.

For example, only on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays.

You can combine this limit with **Duration & interval time frame**.

### Add valid hours per day

It allows you to define exact hours and days when vouchers or promotions can be redeemed.

For example:
- Tuesdays and Thursdays  
- Between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM

This creates a typical “happy hour” scenario.

You can add multiple hour limitations, but they can't overlap.

<Note>

  This limitation can't be combined with the other recurring limitations.

## Valid for a specific amount of time after publishing

This setting allows vouchers to be valid for a fixed period after they are <Tooltip headline="Publication" tip="Publishing means assigning a code to a specific customer profile. This can be done through the Dashboard or API." cta="Read the Publication article" href="https://support.voucherify.io/article/460-how-can-i-publish-codes-to-my-customers">published</Tooltip> to a customer

For example, a voucher is valid for 24 hours after the code is assigned.

The timer starts when the code is published, not when the campaign starts.

This rule overrides campaign expiration dates.

If a voucher is published just before the campaign ends, it will still remain valid until its publication window expires.

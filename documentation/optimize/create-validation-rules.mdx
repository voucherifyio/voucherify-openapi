Validation rules define the conditions that must be met to successfully redeem incentives, earn loyalty points, or trigger distributions in Voucherify. All validation logic is configured in the **validation rule builder**.

<Note>

  Read the [Validation rules](/optimize/validation-rules-reference) article to learn how each rule works.

</Note>

## Access the validation rule builder

You can open the validation rule builder from:
- **Campaign builder**: Create a validation rule while configuring a campaign. A validation rule is then automatically assigned to the campaign.
- **Campaign details**: Open an existing campaign and go to the **Rules** tab. Enable edit mode to create a validation rule or edit an existing one.
- **Validation rules** in the **Campaign hub**: Create reusable rules for future use across campaigns.

## Build a validation rule

Follow these steps to create or edit a validation rule.

The builder looks slightly different when it's opened in different places.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name the rule">
    
    **Name** your validation rule.
    
    If left unchanged, Voucherify uses the default name.

    <Note>

      <Badge color="blue">Builder in Validation rules</Badge>

      When creating a validation rule in **Validation rules** section of the dashboard, you can also select **Context**.
      
      Use **Context** to prepare a rule for validating a specific resource. **Context** determines which rule types are available and it's recommended for advanced use cases.

    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add rules">
    
    **Add rules** to choose conditions from available categories:
    - **Audience**: Customer segments, loyalty tiers, or customer metadata.
    - **Products**: Specific products, SKUs, collections, or prices of items.
    - **Prices & quantities**: Order value, item quantity, or price thresholds.
    - **Budget constraints**: Campaign spend restrictions, like total order or discount values, number of redemptions per period or customer.
    - **Redemptions**: Limits for redeeming users and API keys.
    - **Metadata**: Limits related to custom attributes covering customer, order, redemption, or custom event metadata.

    Some rules also have subrules that can set additional conditions.

    **Edit rule** by clicking the three-dot menu.

    <Note>

    <Badge color="blue">Context-dependent rules</Badge>

    Depending on the **Context** defined in the **Name the rule** step or the dashboard context (campaign builder, earning rule, distribution, and so on), the number and types of rules will vary.

    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define operators and conditions">
    
    For each rule, select operators such as **is**, **is more than**, **after**, and so on.

    <Tip>
      
      You can add multiple conditions within a single rule to refine the logic.

      For example, you can create a rule where the order initial amount is more than \$100 and less than \$150.

    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure junctions and brackets">
    
    Combine rules using logical connectors:
    - **AND**: All rules must be met.
    - **OR**: At least one rule must be met.

    Click the junction to change it.

    Use **brackets** to group conditions into complex logic. You can nest rules by dragging them into bracket groups.
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set error messages">
    
    **Add error message** to define a custom message returned in the API response when a specific rule is not met.

    You can also **Add fallback error message** to the whole validation rule when an error is not specified for a particular rule.

    <Info>

    If no validation rule error message and no fallback message are defined, the API response will not include the `error` object for validation rule violations in some cases.

    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    
    **Save** your validation rule.

    <Info>

    <Badge color="gray">Builder differences</Badge>

    If you configure validation rules through the **Validation rules** section in the dashboard, you will have a **Summary** step where you can **Save** the validation rule.

    </Info>
  
  </Step>

</Steps>

The rule is assigned to the campaign once the campaign builder is saved or added to the validation rule list.

## Using existing validation rules

In the campaign manager and campaign details, you can:

- Create a new validation rule
- Select an existing validation rule
- Clone and edit an existing rule
- Remove an assigned validation rule

Changes made to assigned rules are applied immediately.

## Validation rules with bundles and product discounts

For **bundle** campaigns and **product discount** campaigns, Voucherify automatically creates a validation rule that includes the configuration of the bundle and discounted products.

<Warning>

This auto-generated validation rule cannot be removed from the campaign in the campaign manager or campaign details. You can, however, edit the rule to add or remove conditions.

</Warning>

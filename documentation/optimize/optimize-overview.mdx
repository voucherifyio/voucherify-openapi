After you build campaigns, use the Optimize section to fine-tune how customers interact with your incentives. Control eligibility, set time windows, create rewards, and track redemptions.

## Why optimization matters

Voucherify validates every redemption against your rules. The more precise your targeting and limits, the better your ROI:

- **Prevent abuse**: Budget constraints and redemption limits protect campaign spend.
- **Control timing**: Time limits and validity windows align promotions with business needs.
- **Reward loyalty**: Configure rewards that drive repeat purchases and customer retention.

## How optimization connects to campaigns

Optimization settings work alongside your campaigns:

- **Validation rules** attach to campaigns, vouchers, and earning rules to control eligibility.
- **Time limits** define when campaigns and codes are active.
- **Rewards** power loyalty and referral programs.
- **Redemptions** track all customer interactions with your incentives.

<Tip>

Start with basic validation rules, then add complexity as you learn what works for your customers.

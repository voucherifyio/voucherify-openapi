Voucherify is the Incentive Optimization Engine that helps you move from static discounts to always-on experimentation. After you build campaigns, use the Optimize section to fine-tune how customers interact with your incentives.

## What optimization means

- **Start with the right incentive at the right time for the right customer.** Trigger offers based on behavior and timing because that's what actually moves the needle.
- **Use real-time performance and margin logic.** Instead of fixed calendars, decide when and how to incentivize based on actual data.
- **Experiment boldly with guardrails in place.** Set limits, caps, and roll back underperformers so every test has a margin of safety.

## Why optimization matters

Voucherify validates every redemption against your rules. The more precise your targeting and limits, the better your ROI:

- **Prevent abuse**: Budget constraints and redemption limits protect campaign spend.
- **Target the right customers**: Audience rules and segments ensure incentives reach qualified customers.
- **Control timing**: Time limits and validity windows align promotions with business needs.
- **Reward loyalty**: Configure rewards that drive repeat purchases and customer retention.

## How optimization connects to campaigns

Optimization settings work alongside your campaigns:

- **Validation rules** attach to campaigns, vouchers, and earning rules to control eligibility.
- **Time limits** define when campaigns and codes are active.
- **Rewards** power loyalty and referral programs.
- **Redemptions** track all customer interactions with your incentives.

<Tip>

Start with basic validation rules, then add complexity as you learn what works for your customers.

## What's next?

Start with [validation rules](/optimize/create-validation-rules) to control who can redeem your incentives, or [time limits](/optimize/time-limits) to set when campaigns are active. Use [rewards](/optimize/create-rewards) to configure loyalty and referral payouts.

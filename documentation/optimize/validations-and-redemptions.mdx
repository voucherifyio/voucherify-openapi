The **Redemptions** section in **Campaign hub** is the key place for monitoring how customers interact with your incentives. It helps you track whether codes are being used successfully or why they are failing.

## Key concepts

To understand how Voucherify tracks activity, learn the differences between these three terms:

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Redemptions">

        A **redemption** occurs when an incentive (a code or promotion) is actually applied to an order.

        During redemption:
        * Voucherify records every attempt, including those that are successful, failed, or reverted (rolled back).
        * You can view details such as the customer involved, used incentives, order summary, and the specific campaign.
        * **Rollback**: Successful redemptions can be reverted within 3 months of the event if a customer returns an item or the order is canceled.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Validations">

        A **validation** is a check to see if an incentive is eligible for use before the actual redemption happens.

        In the **Validations** tab:
        * You can check the incentives that were applicable, inapplicable, or skipped during a check.
        * Validation data is stored for 30 days.
        * For deeper technical details, such as request and response data, you can review the **Audit logs**.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Sessions">

    A validation **session** is used to lock a discount for a customer while they are still in the checkout process. This prevents the same code from being used again while a customer is finishing their purchase.

    You can manage and unlock sessions in the **Sessions** tab.

        Validation sessions are created as part of a validation API call.

        Read the developer guide about [Locking validation session](/guides/locking-validation-session).

    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring and data

Use the **Redemptions** sections to monitor and track your validations, redemptions, and sessions.

**Add filter** to narrow down your search.

<Tip>
    
    You can also view **Redemptions** and **Validations** of an incentive by opening its detailed view.

</Tip>


### Failed attempts

If a redemption fails, Voucherify provides a failure reason. Common causes include:

* The voucher has expired or is not active.
* Usage or redemption limits have been reached.
* The order or customer does not meet validation rules.

### Detailed logs

To troubleshoot integrations and validation behavior, use detailed logs.

Each redemption has detailed event data, like `redemption.created` or `redemption.succeeded`. The event data link to a log that shows, among others:
* HTTP method
* Request and response data
* Related events

For validations, use **Audit logs** to view detailed data.

### Exporting data

In **Redemptions**, **Export** redemption data as a **CSV file** for further analysis and tracking. You can apply filters to narrow down results.

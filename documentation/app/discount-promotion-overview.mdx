Discount coupons and promotions are two ways to give customers a certain benefit. They work together but serve different purposes.

## Discount coupons

A **discount coupon** is a code that a customer enters to get a benefit, such as a lower price or free shipping. Coupons are useful when you want customers to take an action, like typing a code at checkout.

There are two main types of coupons in Voucherify:

### Generic (standalone) coupon

A **generic coupon** is one code shared by everyone. Example: `WELCOME10`. All customers use the same code and get the same benefit.

### Bulk (unique) coupons

**Bulk coupons** are a set of many unique codes. Each code can be used by only one customer or a small number of customers. They are often used in emails, loyalty rewards, or personalized offers.

## Promotions

A **promotion** applies a discount automatically. Customers don’t need to enter a code. The system checks the rules in the background and applies the discount when all conditions are met.

## Key differences

- **Coupons require a code.** Promotions do not.  
- **Coupons target specific users.** Promotions target situations or rules.  
- **Coupons need an action from the customer.** Promotions work automatically.

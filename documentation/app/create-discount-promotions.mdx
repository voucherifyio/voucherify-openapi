This guide explains how to configure a cart-level promotion campaign in Voucherify. It covers all essential steps, from defining settings to launching the promotion.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Promotion details

<CampDetails/>

<TimeFrame/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Discount tiers

Each tier defines its own discount and rules. You can create one or many.

For each tier define:

- Tier name

- Banner message (shown to customers)

- Category (for stacking rules)

- Tier timeframe (optional; otherwise inherits campaign timeframe)

## Metadata (optional)

<Step>

## Tier and stacks

Voucherify supports two application modes:

1. **Tiers only (default)**

- Only one tier applies to the cart.

2. **Stacks**

<Tip>
Think of a stack as a “bundle of tiers” that act as one combined promotion.
</Tip>

Possibilities:

- Create combined promotion - in **Tiers and stacks**, use **Create combined promotion** to group promotion tiers in a promotion stack. The order of the tiers within the stack determines the sequence of tier redemptions during a single-order transaction. A single promotion stack can have a maximum number of 30 tiers.

- Combine multiple tiers and apply them together.

- Useful for complex incentives like “10% off + free shipping.”

- You can reorder tiers inside the stack.

</Step>

<Step>

## Define promotion hierarchy

If a cart qualifies for multiple tiers (outside stacks), set the order in which the tier discounts apply.

Use arrows to place the highest priority tier at the top and set the rest in the correct order.

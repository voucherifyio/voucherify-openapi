This guide explains how to configure a cart-level promotion campaign in Voucherify. It covers all essential steps, from defining settings to launching the promotion.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Prepare Your Environment

Before creating a promotion:

- Learn more about the [**Qualification API**](/api-reference/qualifications/check-eligibility). This API checks the customer’s cart in real time and applies promotion tiers automatically.

- Have products, categories, or metadata ready if you plan to build product-based or cart-based rules.

</Step>

<Step>

## Create a New Promotion Campaign

When you create a new promotion, define:

<CampDetails/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Time frame
<TimeFrame/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Discount Tiers

Each tier defines its own discount and rules. You can create one or many.

For each tier define:

- Tier name

- Banner message (shown to shoppers)

- Category (for reporting)

- Tier timeframe (optional; otherwise inherits campaign timeframe)

<DiscConfig/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Tier application

Voucherify supports two application modes:

### Tiers only (default)

- Only one tier applies to the cart.

### Stacks

<Note>
Think of a stack as a “bundle of tiers” that act as one combined promotion.
</Note>

Possibilities:

- Combine multiple tiers and apply them together.

- Useful for complex incentives like “10% off + free shipping.”

- You can reorder tiers inside the stack.

</Step>

<Step>

## Define Promotion Hierarchy

If a cart qualifies for multiple tiers (outside stacks), set priority so Voucherify knows which tier wins.

Use arrows on the right hand side to set the correct order.

Place the highest-priority tier at the top.

<Note>
Highest tier in the list is applied first when several tiers match.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step>

## Metadata (optional)

<MetadataConfig/>

</Step>

<Step>

## Access settings

<AccessSettings/>

<Summary/>

<Calendar/>

This article will explore the most popular ideas for [product bundles and Buy One Get One (BOGO) campaigns](https://support.voucherify.io/article/512-complete-user-guide-on-discounts#bundle). A bundle is a group of products, services, or features offered together as a single package. Bundles are often priced lower than the total cost of purchasing each item separately. In Voucherify, bundles work with cart promotions, generic codes, and unique codes.

The Bundle Multiplication feature multiplies discounts or limits based on the number of bundles in the cart.

## Glossary

**Bundle**

A bundle is a group of products, services, or features offered together as a single package. Bundles are often priced lower than the total cost of purchasing each item separately.

**Bundled Items**

Bundled items are the individual products or services that make up a bundle. When a customer buys all required bundled items together, they become eligible for the bundle discount or reward.

**Minimum Quantity of Products**

The minimum quantity of products defines how many items must be included in the bundle for it to qualify for the promotion. If the customer adds fewer items than the minimum, the bundle discount doesn’t apply.

**Maximum Number of Eligible Bundles**

The maximum number of eligible bundles sets a cap on how many bundles can be counted in a single order. This limit controls how many times the bundle discount can apply per transaction.

**Item Discount Limit**

We recommend setting an item discount limit in:

*   Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit,
*   New price: Apply the discount to item unit,
*   Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items.

Without the limit, each eligible unit receives the discount, regardless of how many bundles are in the order. By default, Voucherify automatically assigns the item discount limit for the discounted items to 1.

## Discount Categories

### Buy X, get Y for free

#### Free products: Add missing order items to match total discount units count

This type adds only the missing free products. It will match the total defined maximum number of eligible bundles limit.

<Accordion title="Free products: Add missing order items to match total discount units count">

**Example:**

Buy 1 laptop → get 1 laptop bag free.

Buy 2 laptops → get 2 laptop bags free to reach the required total.

**Result:**

The number of free products is multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

#### Free products: Always add new units items

This type always adds new free products. It ignores whether the same product already exists in the cart.

<Accordion title="Free products: Always add new units items">

**Example:**

Buy 1 pair of shoes → get 1 pair of socks free.

Buy 3 pairs of shoes → get 3 pairs of socks free, regardless of existing ones.

**Result:**

The number of newly added free products is multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

#### Free products: Add many order items

This type adds multiple free products at once when several bundles are qualified.

<Accordion title="Free products: Add many order items">

**Example:**

Buy 1 pizza + 1 cola → get 2 free desserts.

Buy 2 pizzas + 2 colas → get 4 free desserts.

**Result:**

All free products are multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

#### Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items

This type replaces existing products with upgraded ones. The multiplication applies to both the added and removed items.

<Accordion title="Upgrade Bonus: Replace order items">

**Example:**

Buy 1 small coffee → upgrade to 1 large coffee.

Buy 3 small coffees → upgrade to 3 large coffees.

**Result:**

The number of replaced and added products is multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

### Discount Whole Order

#### Amount Discount: Apply to Whole Cart

This type applies a fixed amount discount to the entire cart. The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Amount Discount: Apply to Whole Cart">

**Example:**

$1 discount per bundle (lip balm + hand cream) 

5 × lip balms + hand creams → $5 off the whole cart.

**Result**:

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and applies to the cart total.

</Accordion>

#### Percent Discount: Apply to Whole Cart

This type applies a percent discount to the entire cart. The percentage value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Percent Discount: Apply to Whole Cart">

**Example**:

5% discount per bundle (cleaning spray + microfiber cloth)

5 × cleaning sprays + microfiber cloths → 25% off the whole cart.

**Result**:

The percentage discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and applies to the entire cart.

</Accordion>

#### New Price: Apply to Whole Cart

This type applies a fixed total price for the cart. The discount value is not multiplied.

<Accordion title="New Price: Apply to Whole Cart">

**Example:**

New total cart price: $50 per bundle (phone case + screen protector) 

5x phone cases + screen protectors → $50 total, not multiplied.

**Result**:

The discount value is not multiplied by the number of bundles. The total fixed price applies once to the entire cart.

</Accordion>

### Discount bundle items by fixed amount

#### Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit

This type applies a full discount to each item unit. The number of discounted units is multiplied by the number of bundles. By default, Voucherify automatically assigns the Maximum eligible units per order item limit to 1. Without a limit, each eligible unit receives the discount, regardless of how many bundles are in the order.

<Accordion title="Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit">

**Example**:

Laptop + bag, get $20 off for a single mouse

#### Cart 1 – Limit Set

**Bundle:** Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** Maximum eligible units per order item limit set to **1**

**Cart contents:**

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 3 – $40 total

**Explanation:**

The cart contains two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2). Each bundle qualifies for one discounted mouse because the discount limit is set to one per bundle. Only two mice receive the discount, giving the customer a total discount of 2 × $20 = $40. The third mouse remains at full price.

#### Cart 2 – No Limit Set

**Bundle:** Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** No maximum eligible units per order item limit set

**Cart contents:**

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 3 – $60 total

**Explanation:**

The cart again includes two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2). Because there is no limit on the number of discounted items, all three mice receive the discount, so it’s $60 in total. The rule applies to every matching product in the cart, not just one per bundle.

**Result:**

The discount value remains the same per unit item. The number of max discounted units is multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

#### Amount discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal

This type applies a fixed discount to the subtotal of each targeted product. The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Amount discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal">

**Example**:

Bundle: Laptop + bag, get $20 off for a mouse collection product

#### Cart 1 – Combined Mouse Order Line

**Bundle:** Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** $20 for each bundle

**Cart contents:**

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 3  (one order line) $40 discount

**Explanation:**

The cart includes two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2), making the customer eligible for a $40 subtotal discount. Because all three mice are grouped in a single order line, the discount is applied once to that line’s subtotal. 

#### Cart 2 – Split Mouse Order Lines

**Bundle:** Laptop + Bag

**Discounted product:** Mouse collection

**Discount rule:** Subtotal discount applies separately to each order line

**Cart contents:**

Laptop × 2  

Bag × 2  

Mouse × 1  $40 discount

Mouse × 1  $40 discount

Mouse × 1  (three separate order lines) $40 discount

**Explanation:**

The cart again includes two complete bundles (Laptop + Bag × 2). Because each mouse is on a separate order line, the discount is applied individually to each line. Each mouse line receives a \$40 discount, resulting in a total of $120 off. **Splitting items into separate order lines increases the total discount amount.** ⚠️

**Result:**

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and applied to the subtotal of each targeted item.

</Accordion>

### Discount percentage off bundle items

#### Percent Discounts (Item Level)

This type applies a percentage discount to targeted items. The discount percent is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Percent Discounts (Item Level)">

**Example:**

5% per bundle (2 packs of crisps) 

4x packs of crisps → 10% off all soda drinks in the targeted collection.

**Result:**

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles. The maximum number of discounted units is not multiplied.

</Accordion>

### Set price for bundle items

#### New price: Apply the discount to item unit

This type sets a new price for selected items. The value does not multiply, but the number of affected items multiplies by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="New price: Apply the discount to item unit">

**Example**:

Set price: \$10 per ticket, $2 per drink 

Maximum eligible units per order item limit set to: 1 ticket and 2 drinks per bundle.

2 bundles = up to 2 tickets at \$10 and 4 drinks at $2 discounted.

**Result:**

The discount value is not multiplied by the number of bundles. The number of affected products is multiplied by the number of bundles.

</Accordion>

### Split discount between bundle items

#### Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to amount

This type splits the discount proportionally based on the subtotal of each item. The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to amount">

**Example**:

**Bundle:** Coffee Machine + Grinder

**Discounted products:** Coffee Beans + Filter Pack

**Cart contents:**

Coffee Machine × 2  

Grinder × 2  

Coffee Beans – $30 (60% of the discounted amount)  

Filter Pack – $20 (40% of the discounted amount)

**Explanation:**

The discount is \$10 per bundle. With two bundles, the customer gets \$20 off in total. The discount is split proportionally — Coffee Beans receive \$12 (60%) and the Filter Pack receives \$8 (40%).

The allocation is based on the subtotal of all targeted order line items, not just the items within a single bundle.

**Result:**

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and split proportionally across the targeted order line items based on their subtotal value.

</Accordion>

#### Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to quantity

This type splits the discount proportionally by product quantity. The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles.

<Accordion title="Amount discount: Split the discount proportionally to quantity">

**Example**:

**Bundle:** Tennis Racket + Sports Bag

**Discounted products:** Tennis Balls + Wristbands

**Cart contents:**

Tennis Racket × 2  

Sports Bag × 2  

Tennis Balls × 3 (60% of the discounted quantity)  

Wristbands × 2 (40% of the discounted quantity)

**Explanation:**

The discount is \$10 per bundle. With two bundles, the customer qualifies for a \$20 total discount. The discount is split based on quantity — Tennis Balls (3 units) receive \$12 (60%), and Wristbands (2 units) receive \$8 (40%).

**Result:**

The discount value is multiplied by the number of bundles and split proportionally by quantity.

## Campaign Overview – Build Section

This section focuses on the mechanics behind your promotion. Every setting you configure whether it’s the incentive type, redemption rules, validation logic, or budget caps maps directly to how Voucherify stores and processes campaign data. The goal is to give you a dependable reference point you can come back to at any time. It’s not a how-to and not a tutorial; it’s the product explaining itself.

Voucherify’s platform is built around the idea of being **modular, scalable, and predictable**, and the Build section reflects that. It gives teams a shared, transparent view of campaign logic so they can design promotions that are easy to maintain, easy to automate, and easy to scale as needs change.

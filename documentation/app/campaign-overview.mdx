Voucherify is an Incentive Optimization Engine, so you you can run fewer incentives, but better ones.

Launch fast.

Test every day.

Drop what doesn’t work.

And optimize what does.

Use the Build section to learn how to create your promotion activities from scratch or refresh your knowledge when you want to tweak and experiment on the go.

Every setting you configure whether it’s the incentive type, validation rules, or budget caps, maps directly to how Voucherify stores and processes campaign data, and, ultimately, to your customer experience.

## Supported campaign types

The Build section supports configuration for all core Voucherify campaign types:

- **Discounts**
- **In-cart promotions**
- **[Loyalty programs](/build/build-loyalty-overview)** 
- **Gift cards**
- **Referral programs**

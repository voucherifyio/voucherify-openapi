## Overview

Do you need to share codes from other sources with Voucherify? You can handle this scenario using the **CSV Import Tool** in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import generic and unique codes, which you can group as a campaign.

<Info>

You can also use this import feature to update existing codes in your campaigns.

* The start and expiration dates in the CSV file should be provided in compliance with the **ISO 8601** norms, for example, `2020-03-11T09:00:00.000Z`.
* CSV columns mapped to Custom Attributes will be added as codes' metadata. The number of custom attributes you can import as metadata is unlimited.
* You cannot import two identical codes to a single Project.
* When importing existing incentives (discount coupons, referral codes, loyalty cards, or gift cards) into a campaign, only two fields can be updated: the **active** status (`true/false`) and the **category**. All other attributes remain unchanged.

</Note>

## Import Discount Coupons

You can import coupons with percentage and amount discounts. First, you should import your codes as generic coupons or group them into a campaign.

* **Generic codes** function as independent promo codes.
* **Campaign codes** are assigned to a particular campaign and inherit its settings (validation rules, timeframe, redemption limits).

### Webhook Triggers

Webhooks can be triggered when you import vouchers from the main campaign list (the **Campaigns** tab) and are sent for each created or updated voucher. They are **not** triggered when you import vouchers into a specific campaign's view.

To enable webhooks when uploading vouchers from the **Campaigns** tab, check the box labeled **Create a webhook sendout for the vouchers created and updated during the import** in step 2 of the import process (**Map Fields**).

## Generic Coupons Import

To import generic coupons, prepare a CSV file with your codes. These codes will function as standalone promo codes, independent of a campaign.

Besides **the coupon code**, your file must include the following coupon attributes:

* **Voucher Type** (text: `DISCOUNT_VOUCHER`)
* **Value** (an integer value - number)
* **Discount Type** (text: `AMOUNT`, `PERCENT`, `FIXED`, or `UNIT`)
* **Code** (the unique discount code)

The following fields in the CSV template are optional:

* **Discount effect** defines how the discount is applied. Possible values include:
    * `APPLY_TO_ORDER`
    * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS`
    * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY`
    * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY_BY_QUANTITY`
    * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_BY_QUANTITY`

<Warning>

For effects that contain `_ITEMS_`, a validation rule is required — without it, the product won’t be assigned to the discount.

The `ADD_MISSING_ITEMS`, `ADD_NEW_ITEMS`, `ADD_MANY_ITEMS`, and `REPLACE_ITEMS` effects are not supported.

</Warning>

* Validation rule ID
* Category
* Active (`TRUE` / `FALSE`)
* Start date
* Expiration date
* Redeemed quantity
* Redeemed amount
* Redemption limit
* Additional Info
* Formula

<Info>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

### Metadata (Custom Attributes) Mapping

To add a field that is unlisted in the built-in properties, change the **Voucherify fields** dropdown to **Metadata (Schema)** or **Metadata (Unknown)** during the mapping step.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Understanding Metadata Overrides">

When a voucher already has a custom attribute, it can be modified, or you can add a new attribute via the import metadata mapping field.

If you want the vouchers to have different attributes than those in the campaign, you must specify them in the appropriate mapping fields in the import file. Otherwise, the campaign's default settings will be applied.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Import Discount Coupons to a Campaign

If you do not have a campaign for your codes, you must [create a discount coupon campaign first](#).

When adding vouchers to an existing campaign, the CSV may contain:

* **Required:**
    * `Code`
* **Optional:**
    * `Active`
    * `Category`
    * `Redeemed Quantity`
    * Custom metadata fields

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings.

### Examples of Inherited Behavior

* If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted from the CSV $\rightarrow$ imported vouchers become `TRUE`.
* If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted from the CSV $\rightarrow$ imported vouchers become `FALSE`.

### Metadata Behavior

* If metadata is omitted $\rightarrow$ the voucher inherits the campaign's metadata.
* If metadata columns are added $\rightarrow$ the mapped metadata only overrides those specific fields.

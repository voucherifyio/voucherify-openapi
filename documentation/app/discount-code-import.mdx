## Overview

What if you want to share codes from other sources than Voucherify? We have placed the CSV Import Tool in the Dashboard to handle this scenario. It enables you to import generic and unique codes grouped as a campaign.

You can also use this import to update existing codes in your campaigns.

<Note>

**Important Notes**

* The start and expiration dates in the CSV file should be provided in compliance with the ISO 8601 norms, for example, 2020-03-11T09:00:00.000Z.
* CSV columns mapped to Custom Attributes will be added as codes' metadata. The number of custom attributes you can import as metadata is unlimited. 
* You cannot import two identical codes to a single Project. 
* When importing existing incentives (discount coupons, referral codes, loyalty cards, or gift cards) into a campaign, only two fields can be updated: the **active** status (`true/false`) and the **category**. All other attributes remain unchanged.

</Note>

## Discount coupons

You can import coupons with percentage and amount discounts. First, import your codes as generic coupons or group them into a campaign. Generic codes function as independent promo codes, while campaign codes are assigned to a particular campaign and inherit its settings (validation rules, timeframe, redemption limits). Note that you **cannot add two identical codes** to your project regardless of the import type.

Webhooks can be triggered when importing vouchers from the campaign list (Campaigns tab) and are sent for each created or updated voucher. They are not triggered when importing vouchers into a specific campaign.

You can enable webhooks in step 2 of the import process (map fields) when uploading vouchers from the Campaigns tab. To do it, check the box labeled "Create a webhook sendout for the vouchers created and updated during the import."

</Step>

### Generic coupons import

Prepare a CSV file with your codes. Besides **the coupon code**, your file must include the following coupon attributes:

* Voucher Type (_text_: DISCOUNT_VOUCHER),
* Value (an integer value - _number_),
* Discount Type (_text_: AMOUNT, PERCENT, FIXED or UNIT)
* Code (the unique discount code)

The remaining fields in the CSV template are optional:

* **Discount effect** defines how the discount is applied. Possible values include:
  1. APPLY_TO_ORDER  
  2. APPLY_TO_ITEMS  
  3. APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY  
  4. APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY_BY_QUANTITY  
  5. APPLY_TO_ITEMS_BY_QUANTITY  

<Warning>

For "_ITEMS_" effects, a validation rule is required — without it, the product won’t be assigned to the discount.

The ADD_MISSING_ITEMS, ADD_NEW_ITEMS, ADD_MANY_ITEMS, REPLACE_ITEMS effects are not supported.

</Warning>

* Validation rule ID  
* Category  
* Active (TRUE / FALSE)  
* Start date  
* Expiration date  
* Redeemed quantity  
* Redeemed amount  
* Redemption limit  
* Additional Info  
* Formula  

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if provided, they will be skipped.

**Import steps:**

1. Go to the **Vouchers** view → **Import tool**.
2. Choose **Import CSV file** and upload your file.
3. Go to **Map Fields** to connect CSV columns with Voucherify fields.

### Metadata (custom attributes) mapping

To add a field unlisted in built-in properties, change **Voucherify fields** to **Metadata (Schema)** or **Metadata (Unknown)**.  
When the mapping is ready, click **Import** and wait for confirmation.

## Import discount coupons to a campaign

If you still need to get a campaign for your codes, create a discount coupon campaign first. Then prepare your CSV file.

If adding vouchers to an existing campaign, the CSV may contain:

* **Required:**  
  * Code  
* **Optional:**  
  * Active  
  * Category  
  * Redeemed Quantity  
  * Custom metadata fields  

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings.

**Examples of inherited behavior:**

* If campaign is active and “active” is not in the CSV → imported vouchers become **TRUE**.  
* If campaign is expired and “active” is not in the CSV → imported vouchers become **FALSE**.

Metadata behavior:

* If metadata is omitted → voucher inherits campaign metadata.  
* If metadata columns are added → mapped metadata overrides only those fields.

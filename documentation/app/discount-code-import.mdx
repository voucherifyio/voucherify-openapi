## Overview

If you need to share codes from other sources with Voucherify, you can handle this scenario using the **Import CSV** tool in the Dashboard. The tool enables you to import generic and unique codes, which you can group as a campaign.

You can also use this import feature to update existing codes in your campaigns.

You can import coupons with percentage and amount discounts. You can import your codes as **Generic** coupons or import them directly into a discount campaign. These coupons inherit campaign settings, such as validation rules, timeframe, redemption limits.

* The start and expiration dates in the CSV file should be provided in compliance with the **ISO 8601** norms, for example, `2020-03-11T09:00:00.000Z`.
* CSV columns mapped to custom attributes will be added as code metadata. The number of custom attributes you can import as metadata is unlimited.
* You cannot import two identical codes to a single Voucherify project.
* When importing existing incentives (discount coupons, referral codes, loyalty cards, or gift cards) into a campaign, only two fields can be updated: the **active** status (`true/false`) and the **category**. All other attributes remain unchanged.

## Importing generic coupons

To import generic coupons, prepare a CSV file with your codes. These codes will function as standalone promo codes, independent of a campaign.

The CSV file should have:
- Required:
    - **Code** (the unique discount code)
    - **Voucher Type** (text: `DISCOUNT_VOUCHER`)
    - **Value** (an integer value - number)
    - **Discount Type** (text: `AMOUNT`, `PERCENT`, `FIXED`, or `UNIT`)
- Optional:
    * **Discount effect** defines how the discount is applied. The values are:
        * `APPLY_TO_ORDER`
        * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS`
        * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY`
        * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_PROPORTIONALLY_BY_QUANTITY`
        * `APPLY_TO_ITEMS_BY_QUANTITY`
    <Warning>

    For effects that contain `_ITEMS_`, a validation rule is required — without it, the product won’t be assigned to the discount.

    The `ADD_MISSING_ITEMS`, `ADD_NEW_ITEMS`, `ADD_MANY_ITEMS`, and `REPLACE_ITEMS` effects are not supported.

    </Warning>
    * **Validation rule ID**
    * **Category**
    * **Active** (values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`)
    * **Start date**
    * **Expiration date**
    * **Redeemed quantity**
    * **Redeemed amount**
    * **Redemption limit**
    * **Additional info**
    * **Formula**

<Note>

Fields other than the ones listed above will not be imported. Even if you provide them, they will be skipped.

### Import generic coupons

Go to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** and **Import CSV**.

    <Badge color="gray">Webhook sendout – prerequisite</Badge>

    To send a webhook during voucher import, you need to configure them in **Project settings** > **Webhooks**. There, select `voucher.created`, `voucher.updated` for the sendout to work.

    Read [Project settings webhooks](/api-reference/project-settings-webhooks) to learn more.

    </Info>

Optionally, you can **Create a webhook sendout for the vouchers created and updated during the import** in the **Map fields** step. This will send a [Voucher created](/api-reference/voucher/created) or [Voucher updated](/api-reference/voucher/updated) webhook when the coupons are imported.

## Importing discount coupons to a campaign

<Info>

    <Badge color="gray">Import coupons to campaign – prerequisite</Badge>

    If you don't have a campaign for your codes yet, [create a discount coupon campaign](/build/create-discount-coupons) first.

</Info>

When adding vouchers to an existing campaign, the CSV should have the following columns:
* Required:
    * **Code**
* Optional:
    * **Active** (values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`)
    * **Category**
    * **Redeemed quantity**
    * **Start date**
    * **Expiration date**
    * Custom metadata fields

All unmapped attributes will inherit the campaign’s default settings.

### Import behavior for selected attributes

Some of the attributes work as follows when imported:
- **Active**:
    - If the campaign is **Active** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `TRUE`.
    - If the campaign is **Expired** and the `active` field is omitted in the CSV, the `active` attribute for the imported vouchers is set to `FALSE`.
- **Metadata**:
    - If metadata is omitted, the voucher inherits the campaign's metadata.
    - If metadata columns are added, the mapped metadata only overrides those specific fields.

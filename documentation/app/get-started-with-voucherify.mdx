Start your journey with Voucherify, an incentive optimization engine, and prepare your account for the first campaign. In this tutorial, you'll learn key concepts of Voucherify that will let you build attractive and effective promo campaigns.

A Voucherify account gives you access to API and Dashboard. This means that marketing teams and developers can create and manage Voucherify promotions. This tutorial focuses on the Dashboard and learning basics.

<Note>

If you're a developer, go to [Developer hub](/guides/introduction) to learn more about Voucherify API and other technicalities.

You can also find there details about [planning your integration](/guides/integration-overview).

</Note>

## Sign up

Voucherify gives you 60 day trial to play and test the platform for free in a Sandbox project.

A project is an environment within a single account to create your incentive campaigns. You can have specific production and testing environments or create separate projects for different markets or time zones.

If you upgrade from trial to a paid plan, Sandbox will be visible in your projects list, but it won't be counted toward your project limit.

## Onboarding

Once logged in, Voucherify will lead you through a marketer onboarding tour. As part of the tour, you can create your first campaign and set up additional rules to fine tune your promotion activity.

You can skip onboarding any time.

### Set up generic code campaign

If you don't want to follow the onboarding tour, you can create your first campaign with this tutorial.

1. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** > **Create campaign** to open the campaign builder.
2. Select **Discount coupons** out of the available campaign types.
3. In **Campaign details**:
    1. Name your campaign, for example *FLASH campaign*.
    2. Select **Generic (standalone) code** and type your code name, for example *FLASH!*.
    3. Leave **Redemption limit** set to **Unlimited**; this means that the code can be used any number of times, by any number of customers.
4. Go to **Time frame**, but leave the settings as they are. You don't need to set up when the campaign starts, expires, or when it's active or inactive this time.
5. Go to **Discount value**, click **Add discount** > **Order discount**.
6. In **Discount type**, leave **Amount discount: Apply to whole cart** and set **Discount amount** to `10`.
7. Go to **Conditions** and click the plus button to open the validation rule builder. Here, you'll set conditions that will limit who can use the code and what the cart will need to inlude for the coupon to be applicable.
8. Click **Add rule**, add name (for example *FLASH campaign validation rule*), and set the following rules:
    1. In **Products**, **Any order item** to **Collection** > All coffees. This means that the cart will have to include a coffee product.
    2. In **Prices and quantities**, **Total amount** to **is more than 99.99**. This means that a customer's cart total amount will have to be 100 or more.
    3. In **Budget constraints**, **Redemptions per customer in a campaign** to **is less than or equal to 1**. This means that a customer can only use the *FLASH!* coupon once.
    4. Click **Save**.
9. In the discount builder, click **Save** again.
10. In **Metadata (optional)** you can set voucher or campaign custom attributes. Skip this step in this tutorial and go to the next step.
11. In **Summary**, you can check the campaign configuration. Click **Save** to create campaign.

## Check default Sandbox data

Sandbox comes with sample products, customers, validation rules, and campaigns. This way you can quickly check out different promotions and the possibilities of Voucherify's rule engine.

Check out the following places:
- In **Campaign hub**:
  - **Campaigns**: lists all created campaigns; by default, Sandbox includes all campaign types.
  - **Validation rules**: lists all created validation rules.
  - **Products**: lists all created products.
  - **Product collections**: lists all collections, which group the products that share defined criteria.
- In **Engagement**:
  - **Customers**: lists all added customers. Be default, you'll have three customers.
  - **Segments**: lists all segments, which group the customers who share defined criteria.

<Tip>

In **Campaigns**, click through the listed campaigns to learn how they're configured. You can also edit them to check their settings within the campaign builder and try to recreate them in other campaigns. Also, it's good to clone a campaign and to tweak their settings in a safe way in their duplicate.

Similarly, you can check and clone validation rules to get a better understanding of how the rule engine can be configured.

</Tip>

## Play around in the Demo shop

Each project has a **Demo shop**. It shows how the integration between Voucherify and customer touchpoints works in practice. You can use **Demo shop** to test the campaigns and check how they work for test customers.

In the Demo shop, you can select a customer to:
- Apply incentives: Use the **Promotions** section to apply incentives.
- Add products to cart: Browse products from the product list and click **Add to Cart**.
- Manage **Cart**: Review your cart.
- Access **Customer wallet**: View coupons, loyalty cards, gift cards, and all the other available incentives in the Wallet Panel.

You can validate and redeem codes from created campaigns to test different scenarios and validation rules for different customers. The results of each redemption are logged in the **Redemptions** section of the dashboard.

Click **API calls** in the bottom panel to see all API calls made throughout the customer journey in the Demo shop.

There, you can see the API methods and endpoints called. You can also check the payload of requests and responses and copy them. You can copy the request payload to use it later on in [Voucherify Postman collections](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/overview "Voucherify public workspace").

Start your journey with Voucherify, an incentive optimization engine, and prepare your account for the first campaign. In this tutorial, you'll learn key concepts of Voucherify that will let you build attractive and effective promo campaigns.

A Voucherify account gives you access to API and Dashboard. This means that marketing teams and developers can create and manage Voucherify promotions. This tutorial focuses on the Dashboard and learning basics.

<Note>

If you're a developer, go to [Developer hub](/guides/introduction) to learn more about Voucherify API and other technicalities.

You can also find there details about [planning your integration](/guides/integration-overview).

## Sign up

Voucherify gives you 60 day trial to play and test the platform for free in a Sandbox project.

A project is an environment within a single account to create your incentive campaigns. You can have specific production and testing environments or create separate projects for different markets or time zones.

If you upgrade from trial to a paid plan, Sandbox will be visible in your projects list, but it won't be counted toward your project limit.

## Onboarding

Once logged in, Voucherify will lead you through a marketer onboarding tour. As part of the tour, you can create your first campaign and set up additional rules to fine tune your promotion activity.

You can skip onboarding any time.

### Set up generic code campaign

If you don't want to follow the onboarding tour, you can create your first campaign with this tutorial.

1. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** > **Create campaign** to open the campaign builder.
2. Select **Discount coupons** out of the available campaign types.
3. In **Campaign details**:
    1. Name your campaign.
    2. Select **Generic (standalone) code** and type your code name, for example *FLASH!*.
    3. Leave **Redemption limit** set to **Unlimited**; this means that the code can be used any number of times, by any number of customers.
4. Go to **Time frame**, but leave the settings as they are. You don't need to set up when the campaign starts, expires, or when it's active or inactive this time.
5. Go to **Discount value**

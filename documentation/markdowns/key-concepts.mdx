Voucherify operates on fundamental building blocks that you can use to create your loyalty and promotional campaigns and integrate them with your system.

Some of the objects in Voucherify are connected together, which builds different business scenarios.

## Project

A project is an environment for managing your activities in Voucherify. A project can be used to run them concerning a brand, region, or currency, or you can use a project for development or staging purposes. For example, each Voucherify account has a Sandbox project for testing purposes.

![Project diagram](/docs/assets/img/guides_getting_started_key_concepts-01.png "Voucherify project diagram")

A project contains all the resources described in this article.

Each project has a set of unique API keys. Also, the data, for example customers, products, campaigns, or all IDs generated by Voucherify, are separate for each project.

<Check>
  Voucherify [Management API](/docs/management-api "Management API"), available as an Enterprise feature, enables you to manage projects through the API. For instance, you can set up new projects with a specific configuration fully programmatically. You can conveniently list projects, retrieve specific project details, update, or delete projects and different project settings as needed.

## Campaigns, vouchers, and promotions

A project consists of campaigns that are based on vouchers and promotion campaigns, which don't need them.

### Campaign

A campaign is a basic entity that is used to carry out promotional activities.

There are five basic campaign types, which create:

* [discount coupons](/docs/discount-effects),
* [loyalty cards](/docs/loyalty-program).
* [gift vouchers](/docs/prepaid-gift-cards),
* [referral codes](/docs/referral-program),
* [promotions](/docs/stacking-promotion-tiers) (without vouchers),

For voucher-based campaigns, each campaign has a set of unique voucher codes, which work in the same way.

Campaigns work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with                    | Example                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Validation rule               | Sets campaign eligibility criteria, like the order total must be over $100. |
| Product or Product collection | Targets discounts to specific products or collections.                      |
| Distribution                  | Sends campaign codes via email, SMS, and other channels.                    |
| Campaign metadata             | Adds custom information, such as images or terms and conditions.            |
| Category                      | Defines discount stacking behavior and helps filter results.                |
| Template                      | Saves configuration of a gift or discount campaign.                         |

<Info>

</Info>

### Voucher

A voucher is an entity that is used as an incentive for end customers. Each voucher has a unique code and ID.

Vouchers can be grouped under one campaign to serve the same purpose. For example, you can create a campaign that assigns vouchers to customers who have a birthday.

A voucher is used in the following types of campaigns:

* [discount coupons](/docs/discount-effects),
* [gift vouchers](/docs/prepaid-gift-cards),
* [referral codes](/docs/referral-program),
* [loyalty cards](/docs/loyalty-program).

<Info>

</Info>

### Promotions and promotion tiers

A promotion is a campaign that groups specific discounts and it doesn't require a voucher to be applied to a customer's order. When a customer or their order qualifies for a promotion, the discount is automatically applied to the order or it can be shown to the customer as a part of the [qualification](#qualification) process.

A promotion tier is a specific discount with conditions. The discount is automatically applied to the customers and orders that meet the conditions.

Promotion tiers can be applied together as a promotion stack or arranged in a hierarchy of an application in one promotion campaign.

<Info>
  * [Promotion tier](/reference/promotion-tier-object) API reference
</Info>

### Template

A template saves a campaign configuration, so it links with all resources used in the original campaign, such as the validation rule, metadata, rewards, distribution setup, and other details. You can use the template to create a new campaign with the same configuration without setting it up again manually or edit its details, if necessary.

## Order

An order represents an order placed by a customer in your system. It contains details about the items and details about any incentives as well as discounts applied to the order.

Orders work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with      | Example                                                                |

## Customer and customer segments

Voucherify can store details about your customers. You can also group customers into segments according to defined criteria.

### Customer

A customer is an entity in Voucherify that represents an end customer of a store, a B2B customer, or any partner who sees products or services. A customer can be assigned vouchers or be eligible for promotions.

A customer object can have many parameters, for example:

* name,
* email,
* birthdate,
* metadata.

Customer entities work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with        | Example                                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer metadata | Adds attributes like VIP customers, region, etc. Used in segmentation. |
| Custom events     | Triggers based on behavior, like app installation.                     |
| Customer segment  | Selected manually as a static segment.                                 |

<Info>
  * [Customer object](/reference/customer-object) API reference
</Info>

### Customer segments

A segment is a customer group that shares the same parameters.

There are two types of segments in Voucherify:

* **static**: it contains a manually prepared list of customers based on customer ID,
* **dynamic**: customers are dynamically added to or removed from the segment if they match a given filter. For example, it can be the customer's birthday is today, they haven't placed any orders in the past 30 days, or they joined a newsletter.

Customer segments work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with        | Example                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer          | Source of data for static or dynamic segments.        |
| Customer metadata | Filters customers based on shared metadata.           |
| Custom events     | Used for rules that define segment inclusion.         |
| Validation rule   | Used to narrow down campaign eligibility.             |
| Distribution      | Used to trigger message sendout to matched customers. |

## Incentivization rules and processes

In Voucherify, you can set rules that govern how incentives, such as vouchers or discounts, are applied. Also, the incentives can be managed under several processes related to their application.

### Validation rules

Validation rules are conditions that are applied to campaigns, generic (standalone) vouchers, promotion tiers, or distributions. For example, the customer or their order must meet the conditions for the incentive to be applied.

A validation rule can be created in advance. It is an independent object which can be attached to or detached from the above-mentioned objects to be reused in the future.

Validation rules work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with                                                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metadata, for example for customers, orders, Custom events, redemptions | Customer metadata can restrict coupon usage to specific user profiles, like allow redemptions only if `customer.region = "EU"`.                                                         |
| Order                                                                   | Set conditions based on the contents of the cart, like Apply a discount on `order.total_amount` above $100.                                                                             |
| Product or product collection                                           | Require or exclude specific products in the cart.                                                                                                                                       |
| Campaign                                                                | Sets eligibility criteria, like a discount campaign can include a validation rule that checks if the customer's order exceeds $100; if the condition isnâ€™t met, the coupon wonâ€™t apply. |
| Customer or customer segment                                            | Apply discounts only to a specific segment, like limit access to the "Loyal Customers" segment.                                                                                         |

### Redemption

Redemption is the process of applying and consuming vouchers or promotion tiers to the customer's order. Redemption checks if a voucher or promotion tier together with the applied validation rules is valid to the customer. Redemption checks up to 30 vouchers or promotion tiers.

Redemptions work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with   | Example                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Metadata     | Used for tracking or limiting redemptions. |
| Order        | Ties redemption to a specific transaction. |

### Rollback

Rollback is the process in which redemption is reverted. A rollback withdraws the incentive from the customer's order and updates its status.

<Info>
  * [Rollback stackable discounts](/reference/rollback-stacked-redemptions) API reference
</Info>

## Communication

Voucherify can be used as part of your strategy for communication with your customer base. Voucherify also supports webhooks to receive notifications about events that occurred regarding, for example, customers, redemptions, or loyalty programs.

### Distribution

Distribution is a process of sending vouchers and other promotional messages to customers. Distribution can be used as a [publication](#publication) method.

There are two types of distributions:

* **automatic**: it is triggered by an event,
* **manual**: the message is sent to all customers or a specified group.

Distribution channels include, among others:

* emails,
* text messages,
* live chat,
* push notifications.

Distributions work together with other Voucherify entities, see examples in the table below.

| Links with       | Example                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Custom event     | Trigger messages when an event occurs. |
| Customer segment | Sends messages to a defined group.     |
| Campaign         | Serves as a source for incentives.     |

</Info>

### Publication

Publication is the process of assigning a voucher to an end customer.

<Info>
  * [Publication](/reference/publication-object) API reference
</Info>

### Webhooks

A webhook is an HTTP callback that is triggered by an event rather than a request. Webhooks can be used to notify external systems about any events or relevant actions performed with Voucherify.

The events can be custom. Custom events are objects that can be used to track end-customer interactions with a system.

  * [Getting started with metadata](https://support.voucherify.io/article/99-schema-validation-metadata) article
</Info>

## Custom events

Custom events are actions taken by your customers. You can use them to track clients' behavior and then build highly personalized campaigns, for example, send customers a 5% off coupon if they've abandoned the cart.

description: "What is Voucherify API?"
---

The Voucherify API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, such as HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API key in any public website's client-side code).

JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.

To make the API as explorable as possible, this documentation has a test mode. You can test all methods at no cost.

In general the API consists of 3 sets:

* **Application API** - full capability, designed to be accessed from your server application
* **Client API** - limited capability, designed to be accessed from your website or mobile application
* **Management API** - endpoints designed to manage Voucherify projects within organization. Enterprise feature only â€“ contact [Voucherify sales team](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-sales "Contact Voucherify Sales") for more details.

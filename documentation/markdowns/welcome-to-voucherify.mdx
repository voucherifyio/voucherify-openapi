## Who uses Voucherify, why, and how?

Voucherify can be successfully adopted across industries in B2C and B2B contexts: e-commerce, travel, or mobile on-demand services.

Applying targeted promotions at every stage of the customer lifecycle can help you maximize engagement. This way, you can acquire customers through social media promotion, convert them with a welcome offer, grow them as customers with referrals, and ultimately, build better retention tactics with loyalty campaigns and re-engage them with incentives that match their profiles. This ideal scenario is possible with proper integration.

At its core, the integration of Voucherify with your system relies on passing relevant context to the Voucherify API, which validates and redeems incentives and rewards in accordance with the rules you set up with the Rules Engine. For more about integrating with Voucherify, explore [Integration overview](/reference/integration-overview).

* Customer Data Platform (CDP)
* Customer Engagement Platform (CEP)
* Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions
* Customer Management System (CMS)
* Distribution tools
* Marketing automation platforms

## What problems does Voucherify solve?

Thanks to Voucherify, you can solve the following problems:

* Integrating promotions with external tools and dynamic customer touchpoints.
* Paying too much for promotion maintenance and real-time monitoring of all digital offers.
* Generating unsatisfactory ROI caused by generic offers, simplistic loyalty programs, and promotional fraud.
* Continuously mediating between marketing and development teams' priorities.
* Wasting development time to write extra code to keep multiple promotion and loyalty platforms in sync across applications, brands, and teams.
* Struggling to build branded customer-facing UIs using legacy and monolithic services.
* Failing to effectively manage traffic spikes and priority changes.
* [Many different promotion cases and issues](https://www.voucherify.io/promotion-examples "Voucherify recipes").

You can achieve this thanks to Voucherify's promotion and loyalty **REST API endpoints** and **a visual Dashboard** to help you with configuration.

## REST API

Thanks to the [Voucherify API](/reference/introduction-1), you can support your system or tech-stack with a platform that creates different promotional campaigns. In a basic scenario, Voucherify can show your customers if they are eligible to the incentives you offer them with qualification, check if they can apply them through validation, and then handle incentive use with redemption.

As the Voucherify API is unopinionated, you can pick whatever you need and build your integration in a smart and flexible way.

Additionally, you can use webhooks to track customer activity or even how your promotional campaigns are managed.

## Visual dashboard

You can manage your promotional campaigns with a visual dashboard. There, you can set up your marketing and development team, configure projects, run campaigns, define rules, and more.

Developers use Voucherify dashboard to get API keys, manage integrations with other platforms, check logs, and configure integration-sensitive details, like metadata schemas. Marketers, on the other hand, use the dashboard to create and manage promotional campaigns.

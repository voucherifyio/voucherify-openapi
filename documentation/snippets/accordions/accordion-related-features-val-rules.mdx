    <Accordion title="Customer segments">

        [Customer segments](/prepare/customer-segments) group customers based on shared attributes or behavior. Use segments in **Audience** rules to target specific customer groups.

        Segments update dynamically, so a rule that targets a segment always checks the current membership.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Product collections">

        [Product collections](/prepare/product-collections) group products based on attributes or filters. Use collections in **Products** rules to define required or excluded cart items.

        Dynamic collections update automatically when products match the defined filters.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Metadata schemas">

        [Metadata](/prepare/metadata) lets you store custom attributes on customers, orders, products, and redemptions. Use metadata in validation rules to create conditions based on any custom data.

        Define metadata schemas in **Project Settings** to ensure consistent data types across rules.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Custom events">

        [Custom events](/prepare/custom-events) track customer actions sent via API. Use custom event metadata in validation rules for distributions or earning rules.

        For example, trigger a distribution only when a custom event includes specific metadata.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Campaigns and earning rules">

        Validation rules control eligibility for:
        - [Discount coupons](/build/create-discount-coupons) and [promotions](/build/create-discount-promotions)
        - [Loyalty earning rules](/build/earning-rules)
        - [Referral campaigns](/build/create-referral-campaign)

        Each campaign type supports different rule categories based on its context.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Developer setup: Validation Rules API">

        Developers can manage validation rules using the [Validation Rules API](/api-reference/validation-rules/validation-rule-object).

        The API supports creating rules, assigning them to campaigns, and listing all assignments.

        <Tip>

        Because validation rules often include complicated logic and many rules, it's recommended to create validation rules through the dashboard to avoid any misconfiguration.

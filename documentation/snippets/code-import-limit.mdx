<Info>

When importing codes to a campaign, the system applies two simultaneous limits for the import file:
* **Code count limit**: Up to **100,000** codes.
* **File size limit**: Up to **10 MB** CSV file size.

The import will stop when **whichever limit hits first**.

Note that **100,000 codes** is the overall campaign code limit. If the campaign already contains codes (e.g., 50,000 codes), only the remaining capacity (e.g., 50,000 codes) will be imported to maintain the 100,000 total code limit.

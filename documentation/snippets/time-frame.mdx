**Time frame** sets additional limits when your customers can redeem their incentives.

Define optional time limits:
- Campaign **start** and **expiration** date
- **Duration and interval time frame** (for example, every 2 days for 3 hours)
- **Valid days of the week** (for example, only Wednesdays)
- **Valid hours per day** (for example, happy hours between 16:00 and 22:00 every Friday and Saturday)

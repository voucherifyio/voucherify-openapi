By default, the campaign uses **Voucher metadata schema**. This will set metadata for the campaign and its vouchers. If you're editing the campaign, changes made to the metadata will apply only to the vouchers that haven't been redeemed yet and haven't been published to any customers.

Uncheck **Use the voucher's metadata schema** to use campaign metadata schemas. The metadata will apply only to the campaign and not to its vouchers.

Metadata allows you to add custom information to Voucherify objects. There are two ways to handle it:

* Standard metadata - These are fields you define in your Project Settings > Metadata Schema. You choose the data type (like string or number) and if the field is mandatory. This ensures your data is clean and consistent.
* Unknown metadata - These are fields sent to Voucherify without being defined first (via API, imports, or manual entry). They are always treated as simple text strings. They are useful for one-time data, but they do not support advanced filtering or strict validation.

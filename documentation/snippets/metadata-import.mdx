Metadata allows you to add custom information to Voucherify objects. There are two ways to handle it:

* **Metadata (Schema)**: These are fields you define in **Project settings** > **Metadata schema**. You choose the data type (like string or number) and if the field is mandatory. This ensures your metadata is consistent.
* **Metadata (Unknown)**: These are fields sent to Voucherify without being defined first (through the API, imports, or manual entry). They are always treated as simple text strings. They are useful for one-time metadata, but they do not support advanced filtering or strict validation.

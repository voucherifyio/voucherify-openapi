<Warning>

<Badge color="yellow">Integration credentials are hidden after saving</Badge>

  When you configure an external integration, API tokens and secret keys are only shown during setup.
  After you save the integration, these values are masked and cannot be viewed again in the Dashboard.

  This reduces the risk of exposing sensitive credentials through the user interface.

  Save your keys securely before closing the window.

</Warning>

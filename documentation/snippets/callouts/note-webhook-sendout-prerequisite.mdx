<Badge color="gray">Webhook sendout prerequisite</Badge>

While importing, you can additionally select the checkbox to **Create a webhook sendout for the vouchers created and updated during the import**. This triggers a [Voucher created](/api-reference/voucher/created) or [Voucher updated](/api-reference/voucher/updated) webhook when the coupons are processed.

To enable webhook sendout during the voucher import, first configure webhooks in **Project settings** > **Webhooks**. Select the `voucher.created` and `voucher.updated` events for the sendout to work.

Read [Project settings webhooks](/api-reference/project-settings-webhooks) to learn more about configuring webhooks.

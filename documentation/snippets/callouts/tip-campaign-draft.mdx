    If you can't configure the whole campaign in one go, don't worry.

    You can **Save draft** of the campaign. Draft campaigns are inactive until their configuration is finished and saved.

    If you **Cancel** the campaign builder, you can return to the builder of that campaign by going to **Create campaign** > **Continue work**. However, if in the meantime you've started creating a new campaign, you won't be able to return to the previous one.

    That's why it's best to save campaigns as drafts if you need to stop your work on campaign configuration.

    <Badge color="yellow">Feature preview: Stacking rules and Categories</Badge>

    This page documents upcoming changes that **are not released yet**. The changes cover how you will manage **Stacking rules** and **Categories** in Voucherify.

    **However, the behavior of stacking rules will not change. You won't have to edit your configuration, as stacking incentives will function in the same way.**

    There will be a new **Stacking rules** section in **Campaign hub**, where you can view and manage your campaign categories, assign campaigns to them, and set **Stacking settings**.

    The final views and configuration options may change.

    Also, the following stacking rule settings are going to change names.

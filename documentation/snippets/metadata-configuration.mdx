Add custom attributes to your campaign for tracking or integrations.

You can either:
- **Use an existing metadata schema**.
- **Add unknown property**: metadata that isn't defined and won't be added to the schema.
- **Add to schema**: define new metadata schema. Once saved, reload the schema to use the new metadata.

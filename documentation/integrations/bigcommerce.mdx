<Badge color="red">Discontinued plugin</Badge>

The BigCommerce v3 plugin is not maintained anymore and it will not receive any updates or bug fixes, as well as it cannot be installed.

However, Voucherify is still compatible with BigCommerce and you can integrate the platforms through the API.

Contact [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support) for more information.

</Danger>

Connect your store with the Voucherify account and let your customers redeem Voucherify promo codes and gift cards in the storefront. BigCommerce integration enables you to sync your customers, orders, products, and their variants. All updates from your BigCommerce dashboard are sent to your Voucherify database in real-time.

<Note>

The integration with BigCommerce uses [webhook limits](/guides/limits#webhooks) for syncing customers and products in BigCommerce, but sending code validation and redemption from BigCommerce to Voucherify consumes [API limits](/guides/limits#api-limits).

</Note>

<Warning>
<Badge color="yellow">Before you start</Badge>

*   Connecting Voucherify to your BigCommerce account will automatically disable BigCommerce gift certificates and coupons. Before installing integration scripts, make sure you have made the necessary migrations and are ready to use Voucherify coupons and gift cards only.
*   The latest v3 plugin version was released on 23/08/2021. It adds support for stacking gift cards and fixed price discounts. If you connected your store before that day, you need to re-install your integration to access new features. [Read how to upgrade your integration](#update-integration).
*   A gift card code cannot have more than 13 characters in Voucherify to be used in BigCommerce.

</Warning>

## APIs for BigCommerce

Integrations created before 2021-08-23 use the **v2 version** of Voucherify and BigCommerce API. BigCommerce stores connected after that date will have **the latest v3** **version** installed automatically.

## How to upgrade to the latest (v3) BigCommerce plugin?

If you'd like to upgrade to the latest version of the Voucherify and BigCommerce plugin, you need to reinstall your integration with BigCommerce. It comes down to [disconnecting](#disconnect-bigcommerce-plugin) Voucherify and BigCommerce accounts and [connecting](#install-bigcommerce-plugin) them again.

## Disconnect BigCommerce plugin

Log in to your Voucherify account and follow the steps below.

1.  Go to the Integrations tab and scroll down to the BigCommerce integration.
2.  Click on **Settings** and **Uninstall scripts**.
3.  Confirm with **Update configuration**.
4.  Click on **Disconnect** to disconnect Voucherify from your BigCommerce store. 

<Warning>
Voucherify coupons and gift cards can't be validated or redeemed from this moment on. Follow the steps below to restore the connection and install the latest version of the plugin.
</Warning>

## Install BigCommerce plugin

1. To connect both accounts, start by logging into your BigCommerce account. Open **Advanced Settings.** 

2. In the next step, you need to generate API keys for Voucherify integration. Go to **API Accounts** and choose to **Create API Account > Create V2/V3 API Token**.

3. Name your new API Account.

4. The API account for Voucherify needs the following OAuth Scopes in your BigCommerce shop:

*   Content (modify)
*   Checkout Content (modify)
*   Customers (read-only)
*   Marketing (modify)
*   Orders (read-only)
*   Order Transactions (read-only)
*   Products (read-only)
*   Carts (modify)
*   Checkouts (modify)
*   Informations & Settings (read-only)

5. Choose **Save** to confirm. Your API account credentials will be automatically downloaded in the .txt file on your device.

6. Now, log into your Voucherify account. Open the **Integrations** menu and click Connect in the BigCommerce integration.

7. Open the .txt file generated in the BigCommerce panel. Copy and paste your Client ID, API path, and API keys.

By marking the respective checkboxes, you can optionally enable the following features:

*   Make calculations based on retail prices (MSRP)
*   Allow applying coupons with other promotions – by enabling this option, **Voucherify's coupons will apply on top of BigCommerce's automatic promotions** (both Voucherify coupons and BigCommerce promotions can be applied)

Lastly, you need to map the source ID (unique customer identifier in Voucherify) to the BigCommerce field. You can choose if the source ID in Voucherify will be mapped to the BigCommerce customer ID or the customer's email.

Confirm with **Connect** to sync both accounts. The app will confirm if the installation is complete with the '**Connected**' button next to the BigCommerce integration. 

8. Now, click  **install scripts** to sync databases and enable your customers to validate and redeem Voucherify codes. 

9. Click **Update Configuration** to finish setting up your integration.

## Update Integration

1.  Go to Integrations > BigCommerce > Settings.
    
2.  When needed, you will be able to uninstall, edit, and reset your scripts. 
    
3.  Click **Update Configuration**.
    
## Data synchronization

When your BigCommerce store is connected, data are synced in real-time. It means that every time you add or update a customer, order, product, or product variant to BigCommerce, it is automatically created in the connected Voucherify account.

The following guides will help you learn how to manage customers, products and orders in Voucherify:

*   [Customers](/prepare/customers)
*   [Products](/prepare/products)
*   [Orders](/prepare/orders)

Thanks to Voucherify metadata, you can also sync the BigCommerce customer groups and product categories. Then, you can use synced data to create campaign rules and limits.

Visit our guide on metadata to learn more about how metadata works in Voucherify. [Read more.](/guides/metadata-mapping)

## Synchronization of customer groups 

Customer groups from BigCommerce are mapped to Voucherify metadata properties. Therefore, to start, add the respective metadata fields in Voucherify customer profiles.

1.  Open the Projects Settings and then Metadata Schema. 
2.  Create a new nested property with fields:  
    
    *   **id** (number) 
    *   **name** (string). 
    
    Nested metadata means that they will be combined and included in the single metadata object representing the BigCommerce group.
    
3.  Now, find the Customers tab to add the metadata object with group attributes to customer profiles.
4.  Then, assign the created nested property to the new object:  **bigcommerce\_customer\_group**.
    
    To sync data properly, you need to use the same name for this object (bigcommerce\_customer\_group) in your Metadata Schema.
    

From now on, if you assign a customer to a customer group in BigCommerce, Voucherify will automatically update their profile (you can see it in the metadata section).

Now, you can use your customer groups to create validation rules (limits and rules of your promotions). [Go here to learn more.](#validation-rules)

## Synchronization of product categories

Product categories are automatically mapped to a predefined metadata field in Voucherify. If you add a new product with categories or update an existing one, the assigned categories will be visible in the product details. 

If you select more categories for the product, Voucherify will display all values as a list. 

You can find IDs of product categories by clicking on the category name in the BigCommerce dashboard.

When the product categories and customer groups are synced, we can use them to create the validation rules described below. 

## Validation rules

Voucherify integration supports validation rules based on: 

*   Order structure and order volume
*   Budget constraints (like redemptions per customer, redemptions per campaign, and so on)
*   Products categories
*   And customer groups

<Note>
If you're not familiar with our validation rules builder, please [follow this guide](/optimize/validation-rules-reference) first.
</Note>
### How to create rules based on customer groups?

If you want to limit code usage to a particular BigCommerce customer group(s), you need to create validation rules based on metadata in the Audience category. 

### How to create rules based on product categories?

You can use your product categories to offer discounts and gift cards applicable to specific product groups. To model this in practice, you need to create a product collection in Voucherify and use this collection to build a respective validation rule.

<Note>
Remember that BigCommerce categories in Voucherify are represented by their IDs. 
</Note>

### Step 1: Create products collection

1.  Go to the Products section and click **Find and apply filters.**    
2.  Create a product collection based on a custom attribute (metadata) representing the proper product category.
3.  When creating collection criteria, you can exclude or include a specific product category using its BigCommerce ID. 
4.  Confirm collection filters with **Apply** and click **Create dynamic collection** to save applied filters and use them in validation rules. 
5.  Name your collection and confirm with **Save**. The collection is ready to use in your validation rules. 

You can read more about product collections in [this guide](/prepare/products).

### Step 2: Add validation rules to your coupons/gift cards

When creating new coupons or gift cards, you can add the following product-specific rules. 

*   **Discount selected:** apply discount/gift card to items from a chosen product category.
*   **Order structure validation rules:** require an item from a particular product category in the customer's cart.

When it comes to the **Order structure** validation rules, you can use product categories to define the required cart items, subtotals, and quantity. Go [here](/optimize/validation-rules-reference#product-metadata) to read more. 

## Coupons and Gift Cards

When your data are synced, and campaigns are live, your customers can enter Voucherify coupons and gift cards when purchasing in your store.

<Note>
**Before you start**

*   **Shipping fee** - Gift cards cover the application of a discount to shipping. When applying coupons, the discount doesn't cover the shipping fee.
*   **Unit discounts** work only with the discount effect _Add new items_ and _Add multiple items_ combined with _Add new items_. BigCommerce doesn't support the _Add missing items_ effect.
*   The maximum allowed **Gift card code length** for a BigCommerce integration is at most **13** characters long.
*   The maximum allowed **Coupon code length** for a BigCommerce integration is at most **43** characters long.
</Note>

### Validation

When a customer applies a coupon or gift card at the checkout, Voucherify API validates the code and sends the response to the BigCommerce store. 

The code is applied only if all rules and limits assigned to the code are met. 

### Redemption

The customer can confirm the order and redeem the code when the validation succeeds. Redemption is always preceded by validation, so any updates and changes that come after applying the code will be taken into account when redeeming the code. The order details are noted in both BigCommerce and Voucherify dashboards. 

## Gift cards

Gift vouchers from Voucherify are mapped to Gift Certificates in BigCommerce. So, all codes that are created in gift card campaigns don't work as coupon codes in BigCommerce anymore (they are recognized as BigCommerce Gift Certificates). The gift vouchers can be redeemed multiple times as long as there is a positive balance on the card.

You can create two types of gift cards in Voucherify:

*   **Generic gift card** – a single gift card code with a predefined balance, typically for multi-use. 
*   **Bulk codes** – one-off codes with the same balance grouped in a campaign. Each unique code can be assigned (published) to a specific customer who becomes the gift card owner as a result.

<Note>
If you need help with creating gift cards, follow this detailed tutorial [here](/build/gift-card-overview).
</Note>

### Stacking gift cards

Your customers can apply more than one gift card to the same cart (up to 30 gift cards). Before clicking **Apply**, a customer needs to list gift card codes one by one, separating each of them using a comma.   

The gifts will be applied in the order they were listed.  

## Discount coupons

You can create a [unique codes or generic codes campaign](/build/create-discount-coupons) with percentage, amount, unit, free shipping, and fixed price discounts.

<Note>
You can read the description of each discount type in [this guide](/build/discount-types-and-effects).
</Note>

You can create two types of coupon campaigns in Voucherify:

*   Generic code – a single discount code with a predefined balance, typically for multi-use. 
*   Bulk codes – one-off codes with the same discount grouped in a campaign. Each unique code can be assigned (published) to a specific customer who becomes the code owner as a result.

## Fraud protection

When your customer applies a coupon or gift card at the checkout, Voucherify validates the code and locks the session. As a result, validated code can't be applied to another cart. The session ends when the customer places the order and calls a code redemption. 

The lock is valid as long as: 

*   The transaction is created in your BigCommerce account.
*   The end-user manually deletes the code from the basket.
*   Voucherify detects a cart error.

Customer Engagement Platforms (CEPs) orchestrate personalized, cross-channel communications based on customer behavior and data. Integrating Voucherify with your CEP allows you to deliver the right incentive at the right time through the right channel.

## Why integrate with a CEP?

Voucherify handles incentive logic: validation, redemption, budget control, and fraud prevention. Your CEP handles delivery: timing, channel selection, and message personalization. Together, they form an incentive loop where every campaign becomes a live experiment you can trigger, measure, and adjust.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Behavior-triggered incentives**: Automatically distribute codes when customers perform specific actions (cart abandonment, subscription renewal, milestone reached).
- **Segment-driven campaigns**: Target VIP customers, dormant users, or any segment defined in your CEP with tailored rewards.
- **Unique codes in templates**: Pull individual voucher codes, gift cards, or loyalty balances directly into message templates.
- **Real-time event sharing**: Send Voucherify events (redemptions, loyalty updates, publications) to your CEP to trigger follow-up communications.

## Integration patterns

Most CEP integrations follow one of these patterns:

| Pattern | Description | Use case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Webhooks** | Voucherify sends events to your CEP when actions occur (redemption, publication, loyalty update). | Trigger follow-up messages after a customer redeems a code. |
| **API calls from CEP** | Your CEP calls Voucherify APIs (using Connected Content, Content API, or webhooks) to fetch or publish codes. | Dynamically insert a unique code into an email at send time. |
| **Custom attributes** | Sync voucher codes, balances, or campaign data to customer profiles in your CEP. | Display loyalty points in a mobile push notification. |
| **Bulk code import** | Export codes from Voucherify and import them into your CEP's coupon list. | Large-scale campaigns where codes are pre-generated. |

## Common scenarios

Explore the common scenarios for using Voucherify together with Customer Engagement Platforms.

### Abandoned cart recovery

1. Customer abandons cart → CEP detects the event.
2. CEP calls Voucherify to publish a unique discount code.
3. CEP sends an email with the code to incentivize purchase completion.

### Loyalty program updates

1. Customer earns points → Voucherify sends a `REWARDED.LOYALTY_POINTS` event to your CEP.
2. CEP triggers a push notification showing the updated balance.
3. When points near expiration, CEP sends a reminder.

### Win-back campaigns

1. CEP identifies inactive customers via segmentation.
2. CEP triggers a webhook to Voucherify to publish a reactivation code.
3. Voucherify distribution updates the customer profile in the CEP.
4. CEP sends a personalized message with the code.

## Getting started

1. **Connect your CEP**: Go to **Integrations** in your Voucherify **Project settings** and configure API keys for your platform.
2. **Set up distributions**: Define triggers (segment entry, custom event, successful publication) and select your CEP as the channel.
3. **Map fields**: Configure which Voucherify data (code, value, expiration) syncs to customer profiles.
4. **Test the flow**: Use a test customer to verify codes are published and delivered correctly.

<Note>
CEP integrations consume [API limits](/guides/limits#api-limits) and [webhook limits](/guides/limits#webhooks). Plan your campaign volumes accordingly.

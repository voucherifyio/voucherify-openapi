Voucherify provides integration with Intercom that enables you to deliver unique coupon codes through both the live chat window and via email.

<Warning>
The integration with Intercom consumes [webhook limits](/guides/limits#webhooks) for sending messages, but actions that are sent from Intercom to Voucherify consume [API limits](/guides/limits#api-limits).
</Warning>

## Voucherify applications for Intercom*

You can connect Voucherify with Intercom by using two applications:

*   **Voucherify plugin**: Enables you to send messages from Voucherify dashboard to Intercom customers.
*   **Voucherify rewards**: Provides predefined messages sent instantly from a Messenger window in response to a complaint or other scheduled events.

## Voucherify plugin – send codes from Voucherify dashboard to Intercom customers 

You can use Voucherify distributions to automatically distribute specific coupons, personalized messages, and promotion info to your Intercom customers.

1. [Connect your Intercom account with Voucherify](#voucherify-and-intercom-integration)
2. [Create manual Intercom distribution to existing customers](#manual-distribution) or
3. [Set automatic coupon send out based on specific rules](#automatic-distribution)

### Voucherify and Intercom integration

Firstly, you need to connect your Intercom account to Voucherify.

1. Select **Integrations tab** in the Home section
2. Expand Intercom integration and click **Connect**. You'll be redirected to an Intercom integration website with required Voucherify permissions. 
3. Choose Connect to confirm and finish the integration 
4. When it's ready, you'll be back to the Voucherify Integrations page. If your account was connected successfully, you'll see it next to the Intercom logo

### Add your customers

When both accounts are connected, you need to add your customers from Intercom to Voucherify. Use [the CSV file and import tool](https://support.voucherify.io/article/67-how-to-import-my-customers) or add customers with [Voucherify API](/api-reference/customers/create-customer). 

You can add custom fields (metadata) to pass customer attributes and Intercom tags to customer profiles in Voucherify. For example, you can attach a property source which equals to Intercom and build a customer segment with Intercom audience in Voucherify:

1.  Add all custom attributes to [the metadata schema](about://support.voucherify.io/article/99-schema-validation-metadata#schema) in the Voucherify dashboard
2.  Create a CSV file with customer's data. Map user ID from Intercom to customer's source ID in Voucherify.
3.  When you have a CSV file with customers data, you can [import customers](https://support.voucherify.io/article/67-how-to-import-my-customers) to your Voucherify dashboard. Go to the Customers tab in the Engagement section and select the three dots in the upper right corner. While importing your CSV, you need to map added attributes to built-in fields and custom fields visible in the metadata section in the customer profile.
4.  Lastly, you can [create a segment](https://support.voucherify.io/article/51-customer-segments) of customers who receive a message with code. Voucherify segments can be based on built-in properties or custom attributes (metadata).
5.  When the segment filters are set, choose Add and Reload. Then, confirm by clicking SAVE.

Now, you can run distribution and send codes to your Intercom customers from the Voucherify dashboard.

### Intercom distribution

In the Engagement section, go to Distributions.

Decide whether you want to set up manual or automatic distribution.

#### Manual distribution

Manual distribution delivers messages once you confirm its settings with **Save & Send.** Each manual distribution is sent with a 10-minute delay, so you can introduce edits or stop the message delivery within this time.

If you chose a customer segment as your audience, 10 minutes countdown starts when the segment is fully synced. Syncing ends once all customers were validated against segment criteria. Syncing status is displayed next to the segment name so you can monitor if the segment is already synced or if syncing is in progress.

In Distribution Manager, set the name, define the trigger and action, and choose your audience. Manual distribution delivers messages to a single customer or all customers from the chosen segment. 

#### Automatic distribution

Automatic distribution can trigger a message in response to one of the following actions:

1.  Changes in a chosen customer segment:
    *   Customer entered segment
    *   Customer left segment
2.  Voucher-related activity:
    *   Gift credits added
    *   Loyalty points added
    *   Loyalty points expired
    *   Voucher redeemed
    *   Voucher redemption rollback
    *   Reward redemption
3.  Cart-related activity (once your order data are synchronized with Voucherify, distribution can respond to changes in customers' orders):
    *   Order update
    *   Order has been paid
    *   Order creation
    *   Order canceled
4.  Customer-related activity
    *   Customer entered loyalty tiers structure
    *   Customer exited loyalty tiers structure
    *   Customer loyalty tier upgraded
    *   Customer loyalty tier downgraded
    *   Customer loyalty tier prolonged
    *   Customer rewarded loyalty points
    *   Customer was referred
5.  Successfully published – the message is sent once the code from a campaign is assigned to a customer.
6.  Custom event - Send messages to customers when a custom event was created for them.

You can name the distribution and choose the message action, trigger, and audience.

### Channels choice & messages

The next step is about channel(s) configuration. First, enable Intercom as the distribution channel. You can enable many channels within a single distribution.

You can choose between Intercom in-app messages and emails. Provide message details and design the template.

## Intercom rewards

Intercom Rewards is a built-in loyalty and incentives system that lets companies award customers with discounts, credits, or access to special features based on their actions or engagement.

You can trigger a personalized "sorry" coupon or a gift card in response to a submitted complaint. Apologies are sent instantly from the Messenger window before any negative mentions start harming your brand.

<Tip>
Before downloading the app, create campaigns with vouchers that you'd like to send to customers via Intercom.
</Tip>

### Installation

1. In the first step, find **Voucherify Rewards** in the Intercom App Store.
2. Choose **'Install now'** and **'Connect'** 
3. While integrating accounts, you'll be redirected to your Voucherify dashboard to choose which of your Voucherify projects should be plugged in. 
4. When the installation is done, you'll be back to your Intercom account.

### Configuration

Specify priorities and map them to existing Campaigns. Go to the Integrations directory in the Voucherify dashboard and expand integration details.

<Note>
If you wish to add a new campaign to your Intercom rewards make sure to do the following steps: go to the Intercom Rewards settings, add a campaign, and then use a Plus button next to the campaign to confirm adding it to the list. You should see an additional empty row added. Then, use an _Update configuration_ button and check if the campaign was added.
</Note>

## Respond to complaints

1. From now on, you can instantly respond to complaints by sending Voucherify codes straight from the Messenger. When the message is ready, choose **'Send'**.
2. Your customers get their codes by clicking on a CTA button in a message.

<Badge color="blue">Auto-increase voucher count mode</Badge>

It may be worth to choose an auto-increase voucher count campaign mode to manage all complaints without worries that codes will run out. The auto-increase voucher count mode extends campaign with new codes according to your current needs.

<Note>
**SPAM prevention**

To prevent false spam reports, you need to inform your recipients of how they got on your email list. Go to the Project settings > Brand Details to compose a short message before creating a distribution. We will automatically place this information in your message footer.
</Note>

Voucherify offers manual and automatic distributions. Manual distribution sends an email message to a selected customer/[customer segment](https://support.voucherify.io/article/51-customer-segments) as a one-time action. Manual messages are sent 10 minutes after you confirm the distribution. Automatic distributions trigger a message whenever a customer performs a predefined action and meets the distribution conditions. 

With your SendGrid account, you can send both manual and automatic messages.

To start a new distribution, go to the Distributions tab in the Engagement section.

Click Manual message for a one-time delivery or choose between the automatic distribution types.

### Step 1: Distribution Trigger

Name your distribution and select the trigger.

In a trigger, define your audience. Some distributions have the audience defined by their type (for example, Order canceled distribution sends messages to every customer who canceled the order). Otherwise, you need to choose a customer or a customer segment that will be your recipients. 

### Step 2: Action

Select the proper action:

*   Notify customers about a [promotion](/build/create-discount-promotions) – select a promotion or promotion tier.
*   Send a unique code from a campaign – select a campaign.
*   Send a plain message – create a distribution without promo codes. 

### Step 3: Channel Choice & Messages

In the next step, you can configure distribution channels. You can chose many channels within a single distribution.

1.  Enable email as your channel and choose SendGrid. If you connect your SendGrid account in the Integrations, you can choose it from the list when configuring an email provider.  
2.  Choose a message template. You can choose between built-in Voucherify templates and dynamic SendGrid templates created in your account. If you choose a SendGrid template, you can place Voucherify variables in it. They will be mapped to fields added to the SendGrid dynamic template.
    
    **You can choose from the following message variables:**
    
    *   customer name,
    *   customer email,
    *   voucher code,
    *   voucher value,
    *   voucher QR URL,
    *   voucher barcode URL,
    *   voucher publication date.
    
    If you want to place the Voucherify variable in the message template, type the SendGrid field name but skip the curly brackets.
    
If you decide to use Voucherify templates, you can learn more about the email editor in our [Email Personalization](https://support.voucherify.io/article/156-how-can-i-create-personalized-messages-with-codes) guide.

### Step 4: Summary

In Summary, check your email distribution configuration. If there are no other modifications needed, Save & Send the message.

You can [analyze and track the performance](https://support.voucherify.io/article/80-distribution-tracking) of your email campaign with built-in analytics. After you confirm distribution, manual messages will be sent with a 10-minute delay, while automatic distribution will be triggered every time a customer performs the required action.

In this article, you will learn how to integrate [Voucherify](https://www.voucherify.io/) and [Amplience](https://amplience.com/). 

## What is Amplience?

[Amplience](https://amplience.com/) is a Content Management System (CMS) that helps businesses to manage and deliver digital content across various channels and devices. Thanks to the [Content Field Extensions](https://amplience.com/developers/docs/schema-reference/schema-examples/extensions/), you can fetch resources from your Voucherify account and assign them to a specific Amplience content.

You can link the Amplience content to the following Voucherify resources:

*   [Campaigns](https://support.voucherify.io/category/387-coupon-campaigns),
*   [Earning rules](about://support.voucherify.io/article/491-getting-started-with-loyalty-programs#earning-rules),
*   [Promotion tiers](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/promotion-tier).

With the Content Field Extensions, you can easily connect the content created in Amplience to Voucherify campaigns, enhancing the customer journey and your marketing team experience by:

*   Adding links to terms and conditions to your campaigns so that customers know what they need to do to receive the discounts. The terms and conditions might be similar or the same for different campaigns, making it easier for the marketing team to manage it in one place.
*   Adding banners and the rules explanations to the Earning Rules so that the customers know how they can earn points. In case a banner or a logo changes, the change will be visible after updating the content in Amplience.
*   Adding banners and promotion details so that your customers know when they are eligible for the discounts.

With Amplience, it is easier to update the conditions, banners, logos, and other promotional material from one place.

## Setting up the integration

### Voucherify

On the Voucherify side, you will need to generate API integration keys for Amplience.

1.  Go to **Project Settings** and in the **General** tab, scroll down to **Integration Keys**. 
2.  Click the plus button on the right.
3.  Fill in the **Name** for your key.
4.  Choose your role from the **Role** drop-down list.
5.  Choose **Amplience** from the **Integration** drop-down list.
6.  Click the **Create Integration API Key** button.
<Warning>
The integration secret key is visible only for 15 minutes when it is generated for the first time or regenerated. Write your key down and keep it in a safe place.
</Warning>

## Amplience

To perform the next steps, your account needs to have the Developer role assigned and the Development tab visible.

### Content Field Extensions

1.  In the **Development** tab, open the **Extensions** tile and click the **Register extension** button.
2.  Choose the **Content field** category and fill in the required fields. Set the URL to `https://cms-integrations.voucherify.io/frontend/amplience`. If your project uses a region other than EU1, the URL should have the prefix `https://<region>.cms-integrations.voucherify.io/frontend/amplience`; for example `https://us1.cms-integrations.voucherify.io/frontend/amplience`.
3.  In the **Permissions** tab, enable all permissions with the exception of the **Allow downloads** permission (it should be **Off**).
4.  Fill in your **Installation parameters** with the API Integration keys for Amplience.

<CodeGroup>
  ```markdown App Keys
{
"APP_ID":"[your Amplience integration keys ID]",
"SECRET_KEY":"[your Amplience integration secret key]"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

5.  Click the **Save** button to add the new extension.

### Content Type Schemas

1.  In the **Development** tab, open the **Content type** schema tile, click the **Create schema** button.
2.  Choose **Code from scratch** and click the **Get started** button.
3.  Specify the content type **Schema ID**, which should be a valid URI. For example `https://voucherify.amplience.com/voucherify-resources` and choose the **Content type** validation level.
4.  Add your required elements to the JSON schema of this content. You do not have to change anything except the properties object. The most important thing is to put a connection to the extension (`“uixtension”`) into the properties object. Below is an example of the basic configuration of the schema. The name of `"ui:extension"` should match the name of the Content Field Extension that you created earlier:
    
<CodeGroup>
  ```markdown Schema
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "https://voucherify.amplience.com/voucherify-resources",
  "title": "[Title]",
  "description": "[Description]",
  "allOf": [
    {
      "$ref": "http://bigcontent.io/cms/schema/v1/core#/definitions/content"
    }
  ],
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "title": "[Content name]",
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 0,
      "maxLength": 20
    },
    "voucherifyResources": {
      "ui:extension": {
        "name": "voucherify-resource"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

5.  Click the **Save** button to save the changes in the content type schema.

<Note>
If you need to update the content type schema, apart from saving changes, you will also need to sync the content type.
</Note>
### Content Types

1.  In the **Development** tab, open the **Content types** tile, and click the **Register content type** button. 
2.  Pick a schema you created in the previous step, specify the **label**, and, optionally, choose an icon or a card.
3.  In the **Associated repositories**, select **Content**.
4.  Click the **Save** button to add your content type.
<Note>
If you need to update the content type schema, apart from saving changes, you will also need to sync with schema.
</Note>
At this point, you can create your own content and use the Voucherify app resources: **Campaigns**, **Earning Rules**, or **Promotion Tiers**.

Once integrated, Amplience automatically creates a new metadata array for linked Voucherify Campaigns, Earning rules, or Promotion tiers upon the first connection. Each **amplienceContentIds** contains the **Content ID**. If a Voucherify resource is linked to several Amplience entries, all those entries will be listed in metadata as **amplienceContentIds** with respective **Content IDs**.

## Linking Amplience content to Voucherify

The integration between Voucherify and Amplience allows your team to create and manage content directly in Amplience.

Once the integration is complete, the content with Voucherify fields can link the content to a Voucherify campaign, promotion tier, or earning rule.

In this example, a content type has a name, description, and terms and conditions fields. It can be linked to Voucherify’s resources.

Voucherify will show the list of all the resources for you to choose from (you may need to save the content first to be able to retrieve information from Voucherify).

Once you choose the resource and the content is published, the **Content ID** will be associated with the campaign, earning rule, or promotion tier in Voucherify.

The linked Content IDs will be returned via the Voucherify API in the form of metadata. Once you retrieve the campaign, promotion tier, or earning rule details from Voucherify via the API, the Content ID list will be returned. Your development team must use the returned Amplience Content IDs to fetch the content from the Amplience CMS.
<Note>
If a campaign uses a voucher metadata schema, updating the content for that campaign will change the metadata of every voucher that was not published and not redeemed. Depending on the number of vouchers, this action can take from a couple of minutes to hours for multi-million voucher campaigns. During that time, the campaign will not allow any changes.

Braze integration lets you to send Voucherify codes in your Braze messages. In this tutorial, we will show you how to send unique coupons, gift cards, loyalty, and referral codes to your Braze users. Voucherify enables you to use [Braze's Connected Content](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/connected_content/), [Braze's Custom Attributes](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/), or Braze's [Promo Codes Snippet](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/personalization_and_dynamic_content/promotion_codes/) to push codes from Voucherify to Braze.

Before you use Braze custom attributes in Voucherify distributions, you need to add your Braze users to the Voucherify dashboard. You can use Braze connected content to synchronize users or import your customers through CSV or API. [Go here](https://support.voucherify.io/article/67-how-to-import-my-customers) to read more about customer import.

## How does it work?

Braze Custom Attributes enable you to assign Voucherify codes to custom attributes in user profiles in Braze. You can use unique coupons, gift cards, loyalty cards and referral codes. First, connect Voucherify with Braze, then create a distribution in Voucherify and finally create a campaign in Braze with the custom attribute snippet in your message template.

## Step 1: Connecting Voucherify account to Braze

First, connect your Voucherify account with Braze. 

1. Copy the REST API Key from your Braze account (it should at least have the `users.track` permission).
2. Go to the **Integrations** directory in your Voucherify dashboard**,** find Braze and choose **Connect**.
3. Paste the copied API Key from Braze and choose **Connect**.

## Step 2: Code distribution

When connected, you can start a new Voucherify [distribution](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work) that assigns a code to the custom attribute in the user profile in Braze. Later, you can use the attributes you received with codes in your Braze campaigns.

<Warning>
<Badge color="yellow">Before importing customers</Badge>

The customer import feature mentioned below is **OPTIONAL**. It is only mandatory if you wish to do a mass sendout. This use case is usually tied to the **manual message** option in the distributions manager, which is described below. In most instances, users are likely to follow a scenario where Voucherify responds to specific events (automatic workflow described below), leading to the saving of a customer with a `source_id` in Voucherify, which in turn triggers a distribution to Braze. We do not recommend importing for every use case, but only for selected ones. Contact Voucherify support team to determine which avenue is appropriate for your use case.
</Warning>

<Note>
Before setting up distribution, you need to add your Braze users to the Voucherify dashboard.

Export customers from Braze with the CSV export. Use Braze `user_id` value to map it to `source_id` in Voucherify.

</Note>

### Set up distribution

You can distribute codes to Braze using two modes:

*   [manual mode](#manual-distribution) or 
*   define an [automated workflow](#automatic-workflow) that triggers code delivery in response to an action taken by your users.

In both manual and automatic modes, Voucherify sends unique codes with their attributes and assigns them to Braze Custom Attributes in users' profiles. 

### Manual distribution

Manual mode works as a one-time action that assigns codes to a chosen audience. Go to **Distributions** in the **Engagement** section and run the Distribution builder.

Choose **Manual Message**.

1.  Name your distribution, choose a category, and select a trigger that will provoke a distribution.
2.  Define what kind of distribution you want to create. In this case, choose a campaign that will be a source of unique codes and select a segment of users or a single customer as your receivers. Read more about customer segments [here](https://support.voucherify.io/article/51-customer-segments).
    <Note>
    For instance, you can create a customer segment by filtering the `source_id` by a common attribute, which lets us create a segment with a filter, for example `starts with braze`. 
    </Note>
3.  In the **Next step**, choose Braze as a channel and map custom fields that will be added to the user profile in Braze. You need to add the field representing the _code of the published voucher_; the rest of the fields are optional.
    
<Note>
'Code of published voucher' field doesn't require pre-creation in Braze. This field simply labels the custom attribute where the code will appear. When the distribution is triggered, Voucherify automatically sends this to Braze, adding it as a custom attribute. In simple terms, this is where you decide how you want to label these fields in Braze.
</Note>

4.  Choose **Next step** to see a summary of the distribution. Click **Save and send** to deliver codes to user profiles in Braze. 

<Note>
Manual distributions are sent with a 10 minutes delay.
</Note>

### Braze's promo codes snippet

The manual distribution allows you to set up the distribution of the promotion tiers. Promotion tiers are not individually assigned like coupon codes. Instead, they notify customers that an available promotion will be applied automatically during checkout. The process is exactly the same as a standard manual distribution, with the exception of mapping specific fields.

All the information regarding the promotion is sent from Voucherify and stored in Braze customer profiles alongside the environment it was sent from and the promotion code in three formats (text, barcode, and QR).

### Automatic workflow

Voucherify can push codes to Braze automatically in response to the following triggers:

*   **Customer entered/left specific Voucherify segment**
*   **Successful code publish** – the message is sent once the code from a campaign is published (assigned) to a customer in Voucherify. 
*   **Order status changed** (order created, order update, order has been paid, order canceled)
*   **Gift credits added** – the message is sent once gift card credits are added to the customer's card. 
*   **Loyalty points added** – the message is sent once loyalty points are added to the customer's profile.
*   **Voucher redeemed** – the message is sent to customers who successfully redeemed vouchers.
*   **Voucher redemption rollback** – the message is sent to the customer whose redemption was successfully rolled back. 
*   **Reward redemption** – the message is sent when a customer redeems a loyalty or referral reward.
*   **Custom event was logged for a customer** - the message is triggered once Voucherify logs a particular custom event.

To set up an automatic workflow with Braze and Voucherify, [visit distributions tutorial](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work).

## Step 3: Use Voucherify custom attributes in your Braze campaign

Once the custom attribute with the code is added to the customer's custom attributes in Braze, you can use it in your Braze campaigns.

Edit the message body and add the custom attribute defined in the Voucherify distribution. Place `{{custom_attribute.${custom_attribute_with_code}}}` to display the unique code.

When it's ready, you can see the code in your message preview.

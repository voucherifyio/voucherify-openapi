This integration allows you to send data from Voucherify to [Batch](https://batch.com/). You can trigger sending messages through action-based delivery and, as a result, send out codes to customers:

*   During bulk delivery to a customer segment,
*   When a customer enters or leaves a customer segment,
*   As a response to an outstanding order or a custom event, 
*   And more!

The integration with Batch consumes message limits for sending codes in accordance with the [Fair Use Policy](https://www.voucherify.io/legal/fair-use-policy-v2-1). The customer must be already recorded in Batch before the action-based delivery.

## Setting up the integration

### Batch

The configuration of the connection requires a set of API keys available in the [General App Settings of Batch](https://doc.batch.com/dashboard/settings/app-settings/).

The keys need to be provided in Voucherify.

### Voucherify

To configure the integration in Voucherify:

1.  Head to the Home section.
2.  Go to the Integrations tab.
3.  Scroll down to the Batch integration.
4.  Click the Connect button to open the integration menu.
5.  Provide the API keys generated in [Batch](https://doc.batch.com/dashboard/settings/app-settings/).

## Distribution process

Once the Batch integration is enabled, you can start sending data to Batch in a [distribution](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work).

**Customer data bases**

Your Voucherify customer database should be up-to-date with your Batch customer database for the distribution to work correctly.

As a result the data shared via Voucherify will be stored in the user’s attributes in Batch.

```
{
	u.voucher_code "blackfriday-3LBhfTr"
	u.voucher_code_barcode "https://dl.voucherify.io/api/v1/assets/barcode/id"
	u.voucher_code_publication_date 09/11/2023 14:09UTC
	u.voucher_code_qr "https://dl.voucherify.io/api/v1/assets/qr/id"
	u.voucher_code_value "$10.00"
}

```

If the user attribute is enabled in the [Custom Data configuration](https://doc.batch.com/dashboard/settings/app-settings/#custom-data-management), you can start using the provided data in messaging.

The detailed process on how to use coupon codes is described in [this Batch article](https://help.batch.com/en/articles/8601919-how-to-connect-batch-to-voucherify).

Distributions allow you to send targeted messages to your customers through various channels. You can trigger these communications manually for specific audiences or automatically based on predefined system events and customer activities.

## Distribution setup

To begin, navigate to **Engagement** > **Distributions** in the Voucherify dashboard. Click **Create Distribution** to open the setup wizard.

<Tip>

You can click **Save draft** at any point during the configuration to save your progress without activating the distribution.

</Tip>

## Manual distribution

Manual distributions deliver messages to a defined audience once you confirm the settings.

<Note>

Each manual distribution is sent with a 10-minute delay. This window allows you to edit or stop the delivery if you notice an error after clicking send.

<Info>

If you create a new customer segment for your audience, the **10-minute countdown** starts only after the segment is fully synced. Syncing is complete once all customers are validated against the segment criteria. You can monitor the **syncing status next to the segment name** to see if the process is still in progress.

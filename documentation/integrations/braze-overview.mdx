Thanks to Braze integration, you can trigger messages to be sent using Action Based Delivery. Additionally, you can synchronize Braze audience IDs to Customer metadata. This feature allows the creation of promotions targeted at specific customer groups segmented in Braze.

<Note>

    The integration with Braze consumes **[API limits](/guides/limits#api-limits)** for Connected Content and **[webhook limits](/guides/limits#webhooks)** for sending codes to Braze with custom attributes, as well as synchronizing the audience in Braze.

</Note>

**The schema below presents 4 separate integration options**.

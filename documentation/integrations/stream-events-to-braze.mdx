The Inbound integration enable you to send Voucherify events to Braze.

First, connect your Voucherify account with Braze.

1. Copy the REST API Key from your Braze account (it should at least have a permission `users.track`)
2. Go to the **Integrations** directory in your Voucherify dashboard**, find Braze and choose **Connect**.
3. Paste the copied API Key from Braze and choose **Connect**.

## Tracking events

You can track events as follows.

### Historical search

Track events taking place in Braze by heading to **Data** > **Custom Events** in your Braze account or **Analytics** > **Custom Events Report** in a new view. Example of such an event would be action-based delivery.

Select the period of time and events that interest you from the available list (events that you send to Braze are automatically added to the search list).

### Customer-specific events

It is also possible to take a closer look at the actions performed by a specific user rather than general statistics by heading to **Users** > **User Search or Audience** > **Search Users** in a new view.

## Action based delivery

Trigger notifications to be sent based on custom events. In the second step of the campaign creation process, **Schedule**, you can select action-based delivery. This type of campaign lets you use your custom events. From the list select **Perform Custom Event** and add it as a trigger.

Then, another list will pop up with events that you have sent to Braze.

You can, as an example, send new codes to all customers who failed to redeem their vouchers and try to make up for their disappointment.

<Note>

Campaigns may use a Connected Content script to publish a unique coupon code and send it in a Braze message. More information about it in this [article](/integrations/braze-connected-content).

Twilio integration enables you to send personalized SMS with coupons straight from the Voucherify dashboard. You can schedule segment- or event-based SMS send outs to engage your customers in the right place and time. 

**The integration with Twilio consumes [webhook limits](https://docs.voucherify.io/docs/limits#webhooks) for sending messages.**

<Note>
**Before you start**

This guide assumes you have already familiarized yourself with the [Distribution basics](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work).
</Note>

## Integration

The integration doesn’t require any line of code and comes down to 3 steps:

1.  In Home section in Voucherify, open the Integrations tab and choose Twilio.
2.  Provide the required credentials from your Twilio account: Account SID, Auth Token, and Sender phone number.
3.  Confirm with **CONNECT**.

From now on, you can set the default prefix (Project Settings) for each country and launch multiple international campaigns. The setting affects any future customer added without a specified dialing prefix.

## Coupon distribution with Twilio

When your Twilio account is already integrated, let’s see how to distribute [SMS](https://www.voucherify.io/coupon-distribution) with coupons from the Voucherify dashboard. Setting up the distribution starts from running the Distribution Manager. Go to the Distributions tab in the Engagement section in your dashboard. 

Now, decide whether you want to set up [manual](#manual) or [automatic](#automatic) distribution:

### Manual Distribution

Manual distribution delivers messages once you confirm its settings with  **Save and send**. Please note that each manual distribution is sent with a 10-minute delay, so you can introduce edits or stop the message delivery within this time. 

Manual distribution delivers messages once you confirm its settings with  Save & send. Each manual distribution is sent with a 10-minute delay, so you can introduce edits or stop the message delivery within this time. 

1.  Provide the distribution name.
2.  In Trigger – Manual message, choose your audience: either a single customer, or a [customer segment](https://support.voucherify.io/article/51-customer-segments). You can define a new customer segment by clicking the funnel icon and Add new segment in the pop-up window.
3.  Define the action:
    * Notify customers about promotion
    * Send and publish unique codes from campaign
    * Send plain message to customers
4.  In Summary, check your configuration and click Save & Send.

If you choose a newly-created customer segment, 10 minutes countdown starts when the segment is fully synced. Syncing ends once all customers were validated against segment criteria. Syncing status is displayed next to the segment name so you can monitor if the segment is already synced or if syncing is in progress.

### Automatic Distribution

Automatic distribution can trigger a message in response to one of the following actions:

1. Changes in a chosen customer segment:
    *   Customer entered segment 
    *   Customer left segment
2. Voucher-related activity:
    *   Gift credits added 
    *   Loyalty points added
    *   Loyalty points expired
    *   Voucher redeemed
    *   Voucher redemption rolledback
3. Customer rewards:
    *   Reward redemption
4. Cart-related activity (once your order data are synchronized with Voucherify, distribution can respond to changes in customers' orders):
    *   Order update
    *   Order has been paid  
    *   Order creation
    *   Order canceled
5. Customer-related activity:
    *   Customer entered loyalty tiers structure
    *   Customer exited loyalty tiers structure
    *   Customer loyalty tier upgraded
    *   Customer loyalty tier downgraded
    *   Customer loyalty tier prolonged
    *   Customer rewarded loyalty points
    *   Customer was referred
6. Publishing codes:
    *   Successfully published – the message is sent once the code from a campaign is assigned to a customer.
7. Custom events – Send messages to customers when custom event was created for them.

You can name the distribution and choose the message action, trigger, and audience.

### Channel choice & messages

In Channels, enable SMS channel settings. You can enable many channels within a single distribution. Choose Twilio as your provider.

Edit the message template and add variables.

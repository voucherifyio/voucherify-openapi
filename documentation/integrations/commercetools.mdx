If you're interested in using the commercetools integration, [visit Voucherify's main Commercetools connector repository](https://github.com/voucherifyio/commerce-tools-integration) and [Gift card connector repository](https://github.com/voucherifyio/commerce-tools-gift-card-connect/).
</Danger>

By integrating Voucherify with your [commercetools store](https://commercetools.com/), you can start offering personalized promo codes and other campaigns with custom redemption limits, unavailable in the standard commercetools instance. These include:

*   Dynamic discounts that change value based on order total and other attributes.
*   Proportional discounts.
*   Multi-tiered double and single-sided referral campaigns.
*   Advanced product and order-specific discounts, including free product offers and BOGO.

In the near future, we plan to extend the integration to include product variants for unit type discounts and cart promotions with customer segments to unlock the full potential of commercetools promotions.
<Info>
commercetools plugin is open source. This means that you can build custom functionalities on top of it based on your unique business needs.

## How does the integration work?

Voucherify and commercetools integration is based at checkout. commercetools fetches Voucherify API to validate and redeem the promo code.

1.  Voucherify returns the result and applies the discount to the order (to the cart, items, or triggers another behavior based on the discount effect).
2.  Once the order is paid, the code is redeemed, and the commercetools order and customer data is synced with Voucherify.

## How to install and configure the plugin?

## Use Voucherify coupons in your commercetools store

Your visitors can redeem Voucherify coupon codes to get a discount while shopping in your commercetools store. The workflow is as follows:

1. A customer selects products to add to their cart.

2. In a cart summary, they can see a field for a coupon code.

3. The customer enters a Voucherify code, and after choosing **Apply**, their order is automatically updated. Applied discounts are also visible on a checkout page and order summary.

4. You can see redeemed coupons in your Merchant Center dashboard. Go to the Orders List section and choose which order you'd like to display. If any coupon has been applied, you'll see it in the order items. 

## Tracking your performance 

Once the plugin is configured, you will be able to use promo codes. For more tracking data, you can visit the Voucherify dashboard. In the Redemptions, Customers and Orders sections, Voucherify collects and presents detailed, up-to-date information.

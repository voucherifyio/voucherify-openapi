With **Voucherify integration for Intercom**, you can trigger a personalized "sorry" coupon or a gift card in response to a submitted complaint. Apologies are sent instantly from the Messenger window before any negative mentions start harming your brand.

**The integration with Intercom - Rewards consumes [webhook limits](/guides/limits#webhooks) for sending messages, but actions that are sent from Intercom - Rewards to Voucherify consume [API limits](/guides/limits#api-limits).**
<Danger>
**Keep in mind that before downloading the app, you should create campaigns with vouchers that you'd like to send to customers via Intercom.**

Voucherify released another app for Intercom - [Rewards](https://support.voucherify.io/article/130-intercom-send-promo-codes-from-live-chat). It enables you to send promo codes straight from a messenger window.

## Rewards – additional options

Some of the rewards have additional options or require special workflows.

### Material reward – fulfillment workflow

Material rewards require manual confirmation:
1. When a customer redeems a material reward, the status changes to **PENDING**.
2. After you physically deliver the reward, confirm it in the dashboard.
3. Go to the campaign's **Reward redemptions** tab and click the check mark to change the status to **COMPLETE**.

### Pay with points reward – validation rules

When a **Pay with points** reward is added to loyalty campaign, you can limit its redemption with validation rules. These rules create limits based on customer, order, and metadata attributes.

To add a validation rule:
1. Open the reward in the **Reward catalog** in the loyalty campaign builder.
2. Click the **+** button to open the rule builder.
3. Create or select a validation rule.

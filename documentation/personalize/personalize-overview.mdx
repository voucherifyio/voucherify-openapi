After you build campaigns, use the Personalize section to fine-tune how customers interact with your incentives. Control eligibility, set time windows, create rewards, and track redemptions.

Use this section to configure the rules that determine which customers qualify for your promotions and when they can redeem them.

## Why personalization matters

Voucherify validates every redemption against your rules. The more precise your targeting and limits, the better your ROI:

- **Prevent abuse**: Budget constraints and redemption limits protect campaign spend.
- **Target the right customers**: Audience rules and segments ensure incentives reach qualified customers.
- **Control timing**: Time limits and validity windows align promotions with business needs.
- **Reward loyalty**: Configure rewards that drive repeat purchases and customer retention.

## How personalization connects to campaigns

Personalization settings work alongside your campaigns:

- **Validation rules** attach to campaigns, vouchers, and earning rules to control eligibility.
- **Time limits** define when campaigns and codes are active.
- **Rewards** power loyalty and referral programs.
- **Redemptions** track all customer interactions with your incentives.

<Tip>

Start with basic validation rules, then add complexity as you learn what works for your customers.

## What's next?

Start with [validation rules](/personalize/create-validation-rules) to control who can redeem your incentives, or [time limits](/personalize/time-limits) to set when campaigns are active. Use [rewards](/personalize/create-rewards) to configure loyalty and referral payouts.

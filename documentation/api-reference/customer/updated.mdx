The `EVENTS.CUSTOMER.UPDATED` event indicates that a customer was successfully updated in Voucherify.

This event is used in a webhook configured in Project settings in Voucherify dashboard.

The following API endpoints can update customer data, but don't trigger customer update webhooks:
- POST `v1/customers/metadata/async`
- POST `v1/customers/bulk/async`
- POST `v1/customers/importCSV`

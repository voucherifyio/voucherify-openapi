Categories help you organize campaigns in the **Stacking rules** view. This way, you can mix and match your incentives, like discount coupons, cart promotions, and others, and set up rules to limit conflicting behavior.

You can create categories, assign campaigns to them, and configure how campaigns behave when incentive stacking applies in validation and redemption.

<Note>

  Some of the settings in categories are affected by stacking settings.

  Read [Stacking rules](/orchestrate/stacking-rules) to learn more about particular settings.

</Note>

## Create a category

You can create a category from the **Stacking rules** view by clicking **Create category**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter category name">
    In **Name category**, enter a name for the category.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set hierarchy">
    In **Hierarchy**, enter a number.

    The hierarchy number helps define category priority when campaigns are applied together. A lower number means higher priority. For example, a category with hierarchy **1** is treated as more important than a category with hierarchy **2**.

    The hierarchy number is displayed next to the category name in the **Stacking rules** view.

    <Note>
    Categories are applied according to hierarchy only if **Hierarchy priority** is selected in **Incentive application order** in **Stacking settings**.
    </Note>

  </Step>

<Step title="Configure stacking eligibility">
  **Stacking eligibility** defines how campaigns assigned to this category behave when they are validated together in the same redemption.

  This setting controls how campaigns from this category interact with campaigns from other categories.

  Choose one option:

  - **Common**: Campaigns follow the application order. They:
    - Stack with other **Common** campaigns.
    - Stack with **Always stackable** campaigns.
    - Do not stack with **Never stackable** campaigns.

  - **Never stackable**: Campaigns in this category block Common campaigns in the same redemption stack. They:
    - Do not stack with **Common** campaigns.
    - Stack with **Always stackable** campaigns.
    - Stack with other **Never stackable** campaigns.

    This option is typically used for exclusive campaigns.

<Note>
    **Never stackable** campaigns can be applied together only if the global limits in stacking settings allow it.
</Note>

  - **Always stackable**: Campaigns in this category always join the redemption stack if they are valid. They:
    - Stack with **Common** campaigns.
    - Stack with **Never stackable** campaigns.
    - Stack with other **Always stackable** campaigns.

</Step>

  <Step title="Configure no effect behavior">
    In **No effect**, choose how the system handles a campaign that has no calculated effect:

    - **Default**: Uses the global **No effect** setting.
    - **Prevent redemption**: The campaign is redeemed only if an effect was calculated.
    - **Force redemption**: The campaign is redeemed even if it has no effect.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure discount calculations">
    In **Discount calculations**, choose how discounts are calculated:
    - **Default**: Uses the global discount calculation setting.

    - **Initial**: Calculates the discount from the original order value.

    - **Discounted**: Calculates the discount from the current order value after previous discounts are applied.
  </Step>

<Step title="Set stacking limit">
  In **Stacking limit**, enter the maximum number of campaigns from this category that can be applied in one redemption.

  The maximum value is controlled by the global setting **Maximum number of valid incentives to apply in a request** defined in **Stacking settings**.

  The stacking limit can be set to the same number as the global setting or to any lower number. It cannot exceed the global setting.

  <Info>
  The global maximum value is 30.
  </Info>
  
</Step>

  <Step title="Summary">
    Check if the data is correct and **Save** to add the new category.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The new category is added to the **Stacking rules** view.

<Tip>

When creating a campaign, you can also create a category in the first step of campaign configuration. This is helpful when you need to quickly add a new category for a specific campaign.

However, you can provide there only its name and hierarchy.

</Tip>

## Assign campaigns to a category

Campaigns are shown in columns, including **No category** and category columns.

To assign a campaign:
1. Locate the campaign in the list.
2. Drag it into another category column.
3. Drop it to confirm the assignment.

The campaign is now assigned to the selected category.

## Edit or delete a category

Each category has a three-dot menu next to its name.

Use this menu to manage the category:

- **Edit**: Update the category settings.

- **Delete**: Remove the category.

## Compatibility guide

Open **Compatibility guide** in the **Stacking rules** view to check how categories interact.

The guide lists category pairs and shows if and how they stack together.

Use this view when you want to confirm how categories combine before assigning campaigns.

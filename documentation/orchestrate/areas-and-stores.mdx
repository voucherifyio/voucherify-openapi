With the Areas and Stores feature, you can create campaigns that target specific markets or stores within one project. You can create areas that represent regions and stores that represent points of sale. This lets local managers run campaigns independently without affecting other regions.

<Info>
Areas and Stores is an **Enterprise** feature.

## Basic principles

This section explains how these elements work together.

Areas, All Stores, and individual Stores are **three separate levels of assignment**. Each level controls access and campaign visibility in a different way.

### Area

An **area** helps you group and manage promotional activities.  
An area can include multiple stores.

- You can assign users and API keys to an area.
- Assigning a user to an area does **not** automatically assign them to that area’s stores.
- Campaigns can be assigned directly to an area.

Area-level campaigns are separate from store-level campaigns.

### All Stores

The **All Stores** option includes all current and future stores within a specific area.

- You can assign users and API keys to All Stores.
- Users assigned to All Stores can manage campaigns in individual stores.
- They cannot manage campaigns assigned only to the area itself.
- A campaign assigned to All Stores will also apply to stores created later in that area.

All Stores gives access to all stores in an area, but it does not give access to area-level campaigns.

### Store

A **store** represents a single point of sale.

- You can assign users and API keys to a store.
- Users assigned only to one store cannot manage campaigns in other stores or in the area.
- Campaigns assigned to one store cannot be used by users assigned to another store.

This level gives you very precise control over who can manage campaigns.

In the UI, stores are labeled as **Area stores**.

### User

A **user** is a person who manages campaigns.  
There are three main roles:

- Admin  
- User  
- Restricted User  

### API keys

API keys can be created with the **Restricted User** role.

- They can be assigned to areas, stores, or All Stores.
- They allow systems (for example, POS systems) to access and manage campaigns only within assigned areas or stores.
- They cannot access campaigns outside their assignments.

### Campaign

A **campaign** is a standard Voucherify campaign.

- It can be assigned to an area, a store, or All Stores.
- If a campaign is not assigned to any area or store, it will not be accessible to Restricted Users.

### How it all works together

You can represent regions, e-commerce channels, and physical stores inside one Voucherify project.

This setup ensures that users can manage only the campaigns that belong to their region or store.

This allows:

- Area managers to supervise campaigns in a region,
- Store managers to manage campaigns only in their store.

You do not need to create multiple projects with the same configuration.

## Roles and permissions

Different roles have different permissions in Areas and Stores.

### Areas and Stores permissions

When creating custom roles, you can use these permissions:

- **Join areas and stores** – the role can be assigned to areas and stores.  
- **Manage areas** – the role can create, edit, and delete areas and stores, and assign team members.  
- **Read areas** – the role can assign campaigns to areas and stores.  

## Role details

### Account Owner

The Account Owner is not a separate role. By default, they have the **Admin** role.

- Only the Account Owner can assign or remove the **Restricted User** role from a team member.
- Other permissions depend on the role they have in the project.

### Admin

The Admin role (or a custom role with the required permissions) can:

- Create, edit, and delete areas and stores,
- Add Restricted Users to areas or stores,
- Create API keys with the Restricted User role and assign them,
- Create, edit, and delete campaigns,
- Optionally assign campaigns to areas or stores,
- View and manage all campaigns and resources.

Admins always have access to all areas and stores.

### User

The User role (or a custom role with the Read areas permission) can:

- Create, edit, and delete campaigns,
- Optionally assign campaigns to areas or stores,
- View all areas and stores,
- Manage all campaigns and resources.

Users cannot create, edit, or delete areas and stores.

### Restricted User

The Restricted User role (or a custom role with the Join areas and stores permission):

- Must be assigned to at least one area, store, or All Stores,
- Can see only campaigns within their assigned areas or stores,
- Must assign new campaigns to one of their assigned areas or stores,
- Can edit or delete a campaign **only if their assignments include all of the campaign’s assignments**,
- Can perform campaign-related actions only within their assigned areas or stores.

These rules also apply to API keys created with the Restricted User role.

<Note>
The default **Viewer** and **Merchant** roles can only view areas and stores.  
They cannot be assigned to them or manage them.
</Note>

## Visibility and activities

Admins and Users can view and manage all resources in all areas and stores.

Restricted Users (and Restricted API keys) have access only within their assignments.

### Limited visibility resources

Restricted Users can see these resources **only within assigned areas or stores**:

- Campaigns  
- Vouchers  
- Redemptions  
- Validations  
- Promotion tiers  
- Combined promotions  

They can perform campaign-related actions on visible campaigns, such as:

- Qualification  
- Validation  
- Redemption  
- Code publication  
- Validation rule assignment  
- Rollback  

### Global visibility resources

Restricted Users can see and manage these resources regardless of assignment:

- Customers  
- Customer segments  
- Validation rules  
- Orders  
- Products  
- Product collections  
- Rewards  
- Locations  
- Categories  
- Distributions  

<Warning>
If a resource (for example, a Reward) is used in a campaign outside the Restricted User’s assignment, they may see the resource but will not see the related campaign details. Some views may be unavailable.
</Warning>

### Management rules for Restricted Users

- They can manage campaigns only within assigned areas or stores.
- They must assign new campaigns to their own areas or stores.
- They can edit or delete a campaign only if their assignments include **all** campaign assignments.
- If a campaign is not assigned to any area or store, it will not be accessible to Restricted Users.

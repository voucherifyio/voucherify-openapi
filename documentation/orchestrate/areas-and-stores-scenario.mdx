This article shows a practical example of how area and store assignments affect what a **Restricted User** can see, edit, and use.

If you are not familiar with the structure or assignment rules, read the [Areas and stores reference guide](/path-to-reference) first.

## Scenario setup

In this project, there are three areas. Each area has three stores:

- **France area**: Lyon, Marseille, Paris  
- **Germany area**: Berlin, Hamburg, Munich  
- **Poland area**: Katowice, Kraków, Warsaw  

## Restricted User assignments

The Restricted User has the following access:

1. **France area only**  
   (This does not include its individual stores.)

2. **All Stores in Germany**  
   (Berlin, Hamburg, Munich — but not the Germany area entity itself.)

3. **Specific stores in Poland**  
   Katowice, Kraków, Warsaw  
   (Not the Poland area and not the All Stores option.)

## Campaign assignments

There are five campaigns:

- **Lyon-Coupons** → Lyon store  
- **Hamburg-Munich-Coupons** → Hamburg and Munich stores  
- **Germany-Area-Coupons** → Germany area only  
- **France-Area-and-Lyon-Coupons** → France area and Lyon store  
- **Poland-All-Stores-Coupons** → All stores in the Poland area  

## What the Restricted User can do

<Info>
In this article, **Use** means the ability to perform:
- Qualification
- Validation
- Redemption

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Lyon-Coupons">
    **Result: No access**

    The user is assigned to the **France area**, but the campaign is assigned to the **Lyon store**.  

    Area access does not automatically include store access.  
    There is no overlap between assignments.

    The user cannot view, edit, or use this campaign.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hamburg-Munich-Coupons">
    **Result: Full access (View, Edit, Use)**

    The user is assigned to **All Stores in Germany**, which includes Hamburg and Munich.  

    The user's assignments include all campaign assignments.  

    The user can:
    - View the campaign  
    - Edit the campaign  
    - Use the campaign (qualification, validation, redemption)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Germany-Area-Coupons">
    **Result: No access**

    The user has access to German stores, but the campaign is assigned to the **Germany area**.  

    Stores and area entities are separate assignment levels.  
    There is no overlap.

    The user cannot view, edit, or use this campaign.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="France-Area-and-Lyon-Coupons">
    **Result: Limited access (View and Use only)**

    The campaign is assigned to:
    - France area  
    - Lyon store  

    The user is assigned only to the **France area**.  

    There is partial overlap.  
    The user can:
    - View the campaign  
    - Use the campaign (qualification, validation, redemption)  

    However, the user cannot edit or delete it because they are not assigned to the Lyon store.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Poland-All-Stores-Coupons">
    **Result: Limited access (View and Use only)**

    The campaign is assigned to **All Stores in Poland**.  

    The user is assigned to specific stores:  
    Katowice, Kraków, Warsaw.

    Even if these stores match the current list, the campaign is assigned to a broader scope (All Stores).  

    Because the user does not have the full assignment scope, they:
    - Can view the campaign  
    - Can use the campaign (qualification, validation, redemption)  
    - Cannot edit or delete the campaign  

    If a new store (for example, Gdynia) is added to the Poland area, the campaign will apply to it automatically. The user will still not have full overlap.

Publication assigns a unique code (discount coupon, gift card, referral code, or loyalty card) to a specific customer. Once a code is published, it becomes linked to that customer’s profile in Voucherify.

Publication is the process that will give the right incentive to a right customer at the right time.

## Core functions of publication

Publications are required for some campaign types and optional for others. In all cases, they help you control who can use a code and how it is tracked.

### Required publications

Code publication is required for:
- **Referral programs**: A publication is required so the system can identify the code owner and correctly count referred customers.
- **Loyalty programs**: A loyalty card must be published to a customer before they can collect or spend points.

### Optional publications

Code publication is optional for **discount coupons** and **gift cards**, especially for generic codes. However, publication helps prevent misuse and it can be used to limit redemptions to intended users.

## Publication methods

You can use several ways to publish codes to customers. It doesn't matter which method you use, you can publish a unique code to only one customer.
- **Manual assignment**: You can publish a code from the detailed voucher view in the Dashboard by assigning it to a specific customer. A short publication builder will walk you through the process, where you can add publication source ID, select the customer, and add customer and publication metadata.
- **Automatic distributions**: Using the [Distribution manager](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work), you can send and publish codes at the same time through channels like email, SMS, or integrations such as [Braze](/integrations/braze).
- **Web widgets**: Codes can be published automatically when a customer completes an action on a landing page or signup form.

    You can also use an API integration and the [POST Create publication](/api-reference/publications/create-publication) endpoint. This way, your system can publish codes programmatically.

## Publication source ID

The **source ID** is an optional identifier used to track a publication.

When you publish a code using the API or through the dashboard and provide a source ID, calling the same publication again with that source ID will always return the same code that was assigned the first time. This makes publication requests safe to retry and helps prevent assigning multiple codes to one customer by mistake.

## Related features

Code publication can be used together with the following features to further optimize and orchestrate your incentive activities.

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Build campaigns with limited voucher use through publication">

    While creating a campaign, you can check **Customers can join campaign only once**.
    
    This will limit voucher use in the campaign so each customer can have only one code published (assigned) to them.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Code publication and validation rules">

    You can use the **Redemption only by code holder** rule to restrict voucher redemptions. Only the customer who received the published code can redeem it.
    
    Add this rule while creating [validation rules](/optimize/create-validation-rules).

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Distributions: Send and publish unique codes from campaign">
    
    [Distributions](https://support.voucherify.io/article/19-how-does-the-distribution-manager-work) are a common way to publish codes automatically. You can distribute new vouchers in response to a trigger, like customer entered a VIP segment or earned a new loyalty tier.
    
    This way you can orchestrate various incentive actions and additionally optimize how you reach your audience.

    <Tip>

        <Badge color="green">Auto-increase voucher count</Badge>

        While creating a campaign, select **Auto-increase voucher count** to publish more vouchers through distribution or the POST Create publication endpoint when the initial batch runs out. This way new customers who join the campaign will receive vouchers.

        You can also use these methods to go beyond the limit of 100,000 codes per campaign.

    <Accordion title="Keep voucher valid after publication">

    While building a campaign with [time limits](/optimize/time-limits#valid-for-a-specific-amount-of-time-after-publishing), use **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** to define how long a code stays valid starting from the moment it is published.
    
    <Tip>

        <Badge color="green">Urgency</Badge>

        The **Keep valid for a specific amount of time after publishing** setting is useful to create a sense of urgency for customers.
        
        For example, you can set the code to expire in 48 hours after it is published to a customer through distribution that notifies them about the voucher. As a result, the customer may feel the urgency to use it, not to lose it.

<Update label="October 7th, 2025" description="v20250910 ‚Äì Added ¬∑ Areas and stores in the Management API">

- Create a new area: `POST /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas`
- Update an existing area: `PUT /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{id}`
- Delete an area: `DELETE /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{id}`
- List all area stores: `GET /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores`
- Get a specific area store: `GET /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores/{storeId}`
- Create a news area store: `POST /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores`
- Update an existing area store: `PUT /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores/{storeId}`
- Delete an existing area store: `DELETE /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores/{storeId}`

<Update label="October 3rd, 2025" description="v20250930_o ‚Äì Improved ¬∑ Time picker">

The time picker has been updated to use a dropdown menu instead of a clock.  
The dropdown provides options every 30 minutes, and any valid time can also be entered manually.

<Update label="October 3rd, 2025" description="v20250930_o ‚Äì Fixed ¬∑ Onboarding and Metadata">

**Onboarding**  
- Fixed the issue where the Demoshop onboarding flow stopped at step 5, so it now continues smoothly through all 8 steps.

</Update>

<Update label="September 29th, 2025" description="v20250924 ‚Äì Added ¬∑ Payload designer">

We have introduced the **Payload Designer** for webhook integrations.  
It lets you choose between sending the full webhook payload or designing your own JSON structure with static values, dynamic Voucherify keys, and nested objects.  
It solves the main limitation of the previous approach by giving you greater control and clarity when shaping webhook data.  
The mapping will be visible in the `data` object in the webhook.

</Update>

<Update label="September 29th, 2025" description="v20250924 ‚Äì Improved ¬∑ Support widget update">

We‚Äôve refreshed the look of the support widget in the Dashboard and introduced a new support link.

</Update>

<Update label="September 23rd, 2025" description="v20250911 ‚Äì Added ¬∑ Earning rules and Verification">

**Earning rules**  
- Added a message that appears when customers reach the 100-rule limit. To add a new rule, you must first delete the existing one.

**Verification**  
- Added `org_id` field to the general tab in the My profile section. Users can use it for verification when requesting sensitive data.

</Update>

<Update label="September 23rd, 2025" description="v20250911 ‚Äì Improved ¬∑ Validation rules and Delete resources">

**Validation rules**  
- Updated the discount campaigns and referral campaigns by renaming the "Validation Rules" tab to "Discount" and aligning its UI with the promotion tier.  
- The tab now displays bundles, included and excluded products, and all application rules.

**Delete resources**  
- Updated the resource delete dialog with a clearer, simplified design.  
- Users can now choose between moving a resource to the bin or deleting it permanently using a streamlined layout.

<Update label="September 17th, 2025" description="v20250905 ‚Äì Added ¬∑ Loyalty">

Estimate how many loyalty points your customers will receive with a new endpoint:  
POST /v1/loyalties/{campaignId}/qualifications.

See the sample request and response:

Request  
Response  

\{  
    "customer": \{  
        "source_id": "customerSourceID",  
        "metadata": \{  
            "reason": "loyaltyQualifications"  
        \}  
    \},  
    "order": \{  
        "id": "ord_113628fa0685537f99",  
        "metadata": \{  
            "source": "qualifyPoints"  
        \}  
    \}  
\}

üöß  
**Point estimation**

This endpoint returns only an estimation, not a precise point value.

Also, this estimation works only for the Order paid earning rules. If a campaign includes tiers, mappings, and multiple earning rules, the calculation becomes more complex. During final calculation, a customer may change tiers and earn more or fewer points depending on other factors.

</Update>

<Update label="September 17th, 2025" description="v20250905 ‚Äì Improved ¬∑ Voucher import and Management API">

**Voucher import**

**Export**  
Export products & SKUs directly from the dashboard!

**Earning rules**  
Added an option to search earning rules by name directly in the campaign dashboard. The search works across all earning rules, is not case sensitive, and shows only rules that match your text.

</Update>

<Update label="September 11th, 2025" description="v20250828 ‚Äì Improved ¬∑ Validation rules and JSON viewer">

**Validation rules**  
Renamed ‚ÄúRedemption by code holder‚Äù rule to ‚ÄúRedemption only by code holder‚Äù to more accurately describe its function.

Improved how objects are shown in the dashboard. Empty objects and confusing property counts are no longer displayed, making the view clearer and easier to read.

</Update>

<Update label="September 11th, 2025" description="v20250828 ‚Äì Fixed ¬∑ Export and Loyalty">

**Export**  
Fixed an issue where users without permission to export publication or redemption data could still see export buttons on the corresponding lists.

For example, if you have a three categories, Bronze, Silver, Gold, you can set up a limit of 2 for Silver, and 1 for Gold, while Bronze is limited by the Maximum count of valid promotions per category to apply in a request. This means that a maximum of 2 incentives from the Silver category and 1 from the Gold category can be validated or redeemed in one stackable API request.

<Update label="August 21st, 2025" description="v20250813 ‚Äì Added ¬∑ New expiration type for campaigns and earning rules, and new drawer view for distribution details">

**New expiration type for campaigns and earning rules**  
We‚Äôve added support for `FIXED_DAY_OF_YEAR` expiration type in Earning Rules. This new option gives you more control over loyalty point expiration, because you can set an exact month and day. This is a perfect option for seasonal promotions, loyalty program resets, or end-of-year expirations. For example, you can set an expiration date of 31 December for all loyalty points earned during the Black Friday sales.

Also, to improve clarity, expiration descriptions now display with short month names and a clearer date format.

**New drawer view for distribution details**

We have added a new setting to Stacking rules: Sorting rule for grouped redeemables. You can now define a general order in which redeemables are applied when stacked discounts (validations or redemptions) include discounts with categories assigned to Joint and Exclusives.

This rule has two options:

- **Apply Joint categories last:** This is a default setting and the current behavior of the Stacking rules. In this scenario, Exclusive categories are applied first and then the Joint categories.  
- **Apply Sorting rule to combined Joint and Exclusive categories:** This is a new setting. In this scenario, Stacking rules combine the discounts assigned to Joint and Exclusive categories into one group and apply the discounts according to the Sorting rule setting ‚Äì request order or hierarchy.

**Filters**  
Incentive filtering in the Validations has been split into two separate filters for better usability:

- **Number of stacked incentives** ‚Äì allows conditions such as 'has exactly', 'has more than', or 'has less than' to filter based on the number of applied incentives.  
- **Incentive name** ‚Äì uses the ‚Äúincludes‚Äù condition to filter by specific incentive names.

</Update>

<Update label="July 29th, 2025" description="v20250704 ‚Äì Added ¬∑ Discounts ‚Äì new value limits for products">

üëç This feature can be enabled for you on demand. Contact Voucherify support to enable it.

You can now limit the number of discounted item units in discount coupons and promotions. With these new limits, you can build a scenario where each of your customers can get for example only 2 discounted product units in total in a campaign and the whole campaign covers only 200 discounted product units ‚Äì units sold above this limit will not be discounted.

The limits cover the following product discounts:

- Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit  
- Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal  
- New price: Apply the discount to item subtotal

You can set the limits for products, SKUs, or collections. The new value limits are:

- **Maximum units per customer in campaign:** limits the number of discounted item units that one customer can receive in a given campaign.  
  For example, the limit is set to 2 for a T-shirt from the Adventure brand. One customer can only discount 2 units of this T-shirt.

- **Maximum units per campaign:** limits the number of discounted item units that all customers can receive in a given campaign.  
  For example, there are 10 Adventure T-shirts that can be discounted. The 10 discounted T-shirts are available to all customers and the customer who buys the 11th T-shirt won‚Äôt receive a discount.

- **Maximum units per campaign for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that all customers can receive in a given campaign.  
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the ‚ÄúAdventure-brand‚Äù collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters will be discounted. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

- **Maximum units per customer for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that one customer can receive.  
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the ‚ÄúAdventure-brand‚Äù collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum one customer can get a discount on a maximum of 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

- **Maximum units per promotion tier:** limits the number of discounted item units that all customers can receive in a promotion tier.  
  For example, there are 10 Adventure T-shirts that can be discounted. The 10 discounted T-shirts are available to all customers and the customer who buys the 11th T-shirt won‚Äôt receive a discount under a given promotion tier.

- **Maximum units per customer in promotion tier:** limits the number of discounted item units that one customer can receive in a given promotion tier.  
  For example, the limit is set to 2 for a T-shirt from the Adventure brand. One customer can only discount 2 units of this T-shirt under a given promotion tier.

- **Maximum units per promotion tier for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that all customers can receive in a given promotion tier.  
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the ‚ÄúAdventure-brand‚Äù collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters will be discounted. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units under a given promotion tier.

- **Maximum units per customer in promotion tier for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that one customer can receive in a given promotion tier.  
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the ‚ÄúAdventure-brand‚Äù collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum one customer can get a discount on a maximum of 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

All of the new limits can be combined with dynamic formulas. A dynamic formula determines the number of units that‚Äôs covered by the limit.

The limits can be configured in the Dashboard and through the API ‚Äì validation rules.

Multiple products and collections are also supported in the API. A new parameter called applicable_to can be added to the following PROPORTIONAL earning rules:  
ORDER_ITEMS_QUANTITY, ORDER_ITEMS_AMOUNT, ORDER_ITEMS_SUBTOTAL_AMOUNT.  

The parameter replaces the object and id fields with an array of objects, which contain an id and an object with a type product, sku, or products_collection.

You can also define a dynamic formula for earning loyalty points. The configuration works in a similar way to a dynamic discount formula.  

The dynamic formula is also supported in the API. There‚Äôs a new points_formula field that defines the dynamic calculation of loyalty points.

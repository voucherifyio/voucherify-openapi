## Improved

### GET Campaign template

The [GET Campaign template](/api-reference/templates/get-campaign-template) endpoint has now a query parameter `expand=json_template`. The query parameter returns a `json_template` object that lists details about the campaign template, like `campaign`, `validation_rule`, or `campaign_type` fields.

<Info>

The update to the documentation is in progress.

### Filters

- Fixed an issue that caused metadata filters with a value of `0` to display empty filter chips and apply incorrect filtering.

- Fixed an issue where value inputs were missing for **Includes** and **Overlaps** conditions when filtering by array date or datetime metadata.

- Fixed an issue which caused advanced filtering in distributions to show only active segments.
Passive segments are now also displayed.

</Update>

<Update label="28th Jan 2026" description="v20260115" rss={{ title: "January 28th release", description: "Added drawers for orders, customers, products, and discount campaigns" }}>

## Added

### Drawers for Orders, Customers, Products, and Discount Campaigns

Orders, Customers, Products, and Discount Campaigns can now open in a drawer view.
This lets you view and edit details without leaving your current page.

### Product Collection Activity Tab

Product collections now include an Activity tab.
The tab shows a history of changes made to each collection.

### Payload Designer

The Payload Designer now supports mapping individual array elements.
You can select specific items using a picker, including quick options for the first item, second item, or a custom index.

### Campaign Templates

Creating campaigns and tiers from templates now uses a wizard-based flow.
You can select existing resources such as product collections and segments during setup.

## Improved

### Order Status Update

You can now update the order status directly from the order header.
This makes quick status changes easier.

### Customer Custom Event Wizard

The flow for creating customer custom events has been redesigned as a step-by-step wizard.
This improves clarity and usability.

### Filtering Earning Rules

You can now search for Earning Rules by name in Campaign edit mode.
Search is case-insensitive.

### Product Collection Edit

You can now edit both static and dynamic product collections directly from the Product Collection view and the Campaign wizard.

### Campaign Template Preview

When creating a campaign from a template, you can now preview discount details and selected resources before creating the campaign.

### Unified Voucher Headers

Discount Vouchers, Loyalty Cards, Referral Codes, and Gift Cards now use unified headers.
This improves consistency and clarity across views.

### Resource Links 

Resource links now support standard browser behavior.
You can open links in a new tab using Cmd-click (macOS) or Ctrl-click (Windows/Linux).

## Fixed

### Validation Rules

Fixed an issue which allowed creating validation rules with unknown metadata properties.

### Discount Campaign Publish Button

Fixed an issue that caused the Publish button to be out of sync with the campaign status.
The button now updates correctly without requiring a page reload.

### Formula Builder

Fixed an issue which caused long parameter names in Dynamic Discounts to be hard to read.
Names are now truncated with an ellipsis and shown in full using a tooltip.

### Resource Links

Fixed an issue where resource links could get stuck in an infinite loading state after a page refresh.

### Filters

Fixed an issue which caused filter controls to overflow when multiple conditions were added.
All controls now remain visible and accessible.

### Validation Rules Input

Fixed an issue which caused the Validation Rules input to become disabled after clearing a selected rule while editing a discount campaign.
The input now stays active and allows selecting or creating a new rule.

</Update>

<Update label="19th Jan 2026" description="v20260107" rss={{ title: "January 19th release", description: "Fixed voucher publication performance and loyalty points rounding" }}>

## Fixed

### Voucher Publication Performance

Fixed an issue that caused very slow voucher publication for large campaigns where all vouchers were already published.
The system now skips unnecessary checks and creates a new voucher immediately, which significantly improves performance for large campaigns.

### Loyalty Points Rounding

Fixed an issue that mainly affected loyalty programs using formulas to calculate points.
When a formula returned a decimal value, points were not added because only whole numbers were supported.
Points are now automatically rounded to the nearest whole number before being added to the customer’s loyalty card.

### Loyalty campaigns

Fixed an issue where Validation Rules could not be added when creating or editing Earning Rules in Loyalty campaigns.

</Update>

<Update label="15th Jan 2026" description="v20260108" rss={{ title: "January 15th release", description: "Introducing audit log browser" }}>

## Added

### Exported Audit Log Browser

You can now browse exported API audit logs directly in the app.
The new browser lets you search, filter, and view log details for ready exports created within the last 90 days. This makes reviewing API activity easier.

## Improved

### Voucher Filtering

The filter previously named Voucher quantity is now called Redemptions quantity.
This name better reflects what the filter does when searching vouchers.

### Consistent Tab Names

Tab names across campaigns, vouchers, and customer views are now more consistent.
For example, Validation Rule is now Rules, and Redemption History is now Redemptions.

### Unified Validation Rules Tab

The Rules tab now looks and works the same for Discount coupons, Gift cards, and Referral codes.
This makes validation rules easier to understand and manage.

### Payload Designer

The Payload Designer now supports mapping individual Voucherify metadata fields into the payload.
This allows more flexible payload configuration.

## Fixed

### Campaign Templates and Segments

Fixed an issue which caused campaigns created from templates to reuse an edited dynamic segment instead of creating a new segment based on the template.

### Approval Requests for Promotion Tiers

Fixed an issue that prevented approval requests from being triggered when users with limited permissions edited promotion tiers.

### Braze Channel in Distributions

Fixed an issue which caused the Braze distribution channel to be missing for some triggers.
The channel is now available for Reward redeemed, Loyalty points adjusted, and Customer rewarded loyalty points.

</Update>

<Update label="7th Jan 2026" description="v20251219" rss={{ title: "January 7th release", description: "Introducing drawers to rewards" }}>

## Added

### Introduce drawers to rewards

Rewards now support drawers for a smoother navigation experience. When a reward is opened via an in-app resource link, it will open in a drawer, while opening the link in a new tab displays a dedicated reward page. This ensures consistent behavior with existing resource links and event handling.

## Improved

### Drawer headers

Drawer headers now display pills in a unified and consistent order across all resources. This standardization improves visual consistency and makes key information easier to scan and predict.

## Fixed

### Filters 

Fixed a server error (500) that occurred when filtering resources by metadata with large IN conditions (more than 21 values).

### Areas and Stores

Fixed an issue where cloned campaigns lost Area and Store assignments after an approval request was approved.

</Update>

<Update label="22th Dec 2025" description="v20251208" rss={{ title: "December 22th release", description: "New endpoints for product collections API" }}>

## Added

### Product collections – API

This release brings two new functionalities to the product collection API.

You can now use the PUT `v1/product-collections/{productCollectionId}` endpoint to:
- Update the name of a static or auto-update product collection.
- Update the filters of an auto-update product collection.

This way you can change the products covered by an auto-update collection, so you don’t have to add a new collection and edit your campaigns when you need to quickly tweak which products your promotion activities target.

Additionally, you can now use the GET `v1/product-collections/{productCollectionId}/activities` endpoint to check when the product collection was created and its name or filters updated.

## Improved

- **GET `v1/products/{productId}` endpoint**: Added a query parameter `hide=sku` to return only the product data without its SKUs.
- **GET `v1/segments/{segmentId}/activities` endpoint**: Added `has_more` and `starting_after_id` fields for pagination.
- **Preference center**: Customer email preferences can now be managed from the customer’s profile by clicking the cog button in the top right corner of the screen.

</Update>


<Update label="19th Dec 2025" description="v20251211" rss={{ title: "December 19th release", description: "Customer segment events and new UI drawers" }}>

Welcome to your latest Voucherify update! Here's what's new, improved, and fixed!

## Added

### Customer Segments: Activity tab

**Customer Segment** pages now include a new **Activity** tab that provides a clear view of segment events. This log lists segment creation, activation, and update, helping teams better understand how segments change over time.

### Audit log: New drawer views for Background tasks and Exports

You can now preview **Background tasks** and **Exports** details in a drawer, so you can access information directly from the list view and you don't have to leave your current context.

### Vouchers list: Campaign is Unknown filter

The **Vouchers** list now supports filtering vouchers with or without a campaign assignment.

## Improved

### Drawers: Consistent design

The design and behavior of resource drawers (logs, metadata schemas, distributions, and so on) have been improved for better consistency and usability.

### Vouchers: Validation history

The **Validation history** view in voucher details has been updated. Vouchers are now automatically scoped to the current incentive via a pre-set, non-removable filter, so you only see relevant results. You can also filter by status and creation date.

### Approval requests: Multiple edits

Improved the approval requests list to make it easier to review and manage approvals for related resources.

## Fixed

- **Approval requests: Multiple edits**: Fixed an issue where approval requests could not be approved if multiple edits targeted the same object.
- **Earning rules: Long names**: Fixed an issue where long earning rule names overlapped the action menu, making edit and delete actions inaccessible.
- **Distributions: Infinite loader**: Fixed an issue where an infinite loading icon was displayed in the Distribution drawer after changing the distribution status.
- **Loyalty campaigns: Earning rule Mapping**: Fixed an issue where earning rule mappings were unintentionally removed during loyalty campaign edits.

</Update>


<Update label="December 15th, 2025" description="v20251203_o">

## Hotfix

### Payload Designer

Resolved an issue where webhook payloads did not include certain custom event data. Webhooks now correctly deliver all configured custom payload fields.

</Update>

<Update label="15th Dec 2025" description="New API endpoint documentation" rss={{ title: "New documentation", description: "API reference for POST Loyalty point estimation" }}>

## v1/loyalties API

The documentation for endpoint POST `v1/loyalties/{campaignId}/qualifications` [has just been added](/api-reference/loyalties/estimate-loyalty-points).

Use this endpoint to calculate an estimate number of points that a customer will receive for their order. The points are calculated for earning rules based on the order paid rule.

</Update>


<Update label="11th Dec 2025" description="v20251203_o" rss={{ title: "December 11th release", description: "Discount and Loyalty fixes and improvements" }}>

## Improved

### Loyalty Program Experience 

Labels and info panels in Loyalty Campaigns now explain points expiration rules more clearly. This helps users understand how expiration works and what options are available.

### Discount Campaign Dashboard

The Dashboard tab in Discount Campaigns has a cleaner and more focused design.

### Discount Campaign Header

The Discount Campaign header has been updated for a clearer and more streamlined management experience.

### Product Selection in Discounts

When using Add Items, the first empty field in the Bundled Items or Discounted Items list is now filled automatically. New items are no longer added to the next position when an empty field is available.

## Fixed

### Discount Campaign Analytics

Fixed an issue which caused the “Total orders value” and “Discounted amount” to be missing from the Orders analytics chart for Discount Campaigns. These values now display correctly.

### Discount Value Fallback 

Fixed an issue which caused the Discount value fallback to be hidden in campaign details for discount types created with the formula builder. The fallback value is now always visible.

### Formula Tooltip Consistency 

Fixed an issue that caused the fallback tooltip in Discount Campaigns to show raw API values. The tooltip now displays the same formatted value shown on the dashboard.

### Activity Log Button

Fixed an issue that made the Log button unavailable for events in the Activity tab. The Log button is now enabled for all events with an associated log.

### Passive Segments in Referral Campaigns 

Fixed an issue which caused customer segments triggered by tiers in Referral Campaigns to be created incorrectly when using the approval flow. Segments now appear with the correct name and filter.

</Update>

<Update label="3rd Dec 2025" description="v20251203" rss={{ title: "December 3rd release", description: "Fix to qualifications" }}>

## Fixed
- **Qualifications**: Fixed an issue that failed to return redeemables in campaigns with a validity time frame set with interval and duration when daylight saving time changes.

</Update>

<Update label="2nd Dec 2025" description="v20251125" rss={{ title: "December 2nd release", description: "Activity tab advanced filtering" }}>

## Added

This version brings several new features to Voucherify.

### Activity Tab – Advanced Filtering & Navigation
The Activity tab now has a new table view with advanced filters. You can filter by event name, category, date, and context-specific options (such as campaign or campaign type in Customers). This makes it easier to find specific changes without scrolling through long lists.

### Validation Rules in Drawers

Validation rules now open in drawers. This lets you view rule details without leaving your current page.

### Voucher Import CSV
You can now map two new fields in CSV imports: start_date and expiration_date. These fields are supported when importing vouchers into campaigns and when creating standalone vouchers.
 
## Improved

### Discount Campaign Analytics Tab

The Analytics tab in Discount Campaigns has a cleaner layout. You can choose how many charts to show per row (1–3), making it easier to view and compare results. All existing analytics features remain available.

### Discount Wizard – Step Summaries

The discount wizard now shows key discount details under each step title. This includes discount type, value, effect, and related product, SKU, or collection links with “Show more” support. Validation rule names are shown as plain values, and steps without a rule are clearly marked.

## Fixed

### Metadata Dictionary Validation

Fixed an issue where users could continue even when a metadata dictionary value was invalid or removed. You must now fix all metadata errors before proceeding, including in cross-project approval scenarios.

### Approvals – Duplicate Error Toasts

Fixed an issue that caused two error toasts to appear when an approval failed. Only one clear error message is now shown, giving you enough time to read and understand it.

### Product Search
Fixed an issue that made product search case-sensitive and unclear. Search is now case-insensitive and begins after you type 3 characters. The “No items found” message only appears after 3 characters. Products with very short names can still be found with advanced filters.

</Update>

<Update label="25th Nov 2025" description="v20251124" rss={{ title: "November 25th release", description: "New customer segment endpoints" }}>

## Added

This version brings several new features to Voucherify.

### Webhooks

You can now monitor changes to your customer profiles with the new webhook covering the `customer.updated` event. You can find this webhook in Project settings. This webhook is not triggered by bulk customer updates, like import customers with a CSV file, update customers in bulk, or update customers' metadata in bulk.

### Customer segments
This version brings a couple of new features to customer segments.

We've added a new API endpoint GET v1/segments to list your segments. You can use the following query parameters:
- `limit` with a maximum value of 100
- `order` with `created_at` (ascending) and `-created_at` (descending) values
- `filters` with `id`, `type`, `name`, `created_at` values
- `starting_after` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `ids` with an ID as a string or an array of ID strings

Additionally, there's another new API endpoint for monitoring activities in the segment, GET `v1/segments/{id}/activities`. You can list the following events related to that segment:
- created
- updated
- activated
- filters_updated

You can use the following query parameters:

- `limit` with a maximum value of 100
- `order` with `created_at` (ascending) and `-created_at` (descending) values
- `starting_after` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `starting_after_id` with an activity ID; it returns activities created after this activity.
- `start_date` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `end_date` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `type` with an event type name
- `category` with an event category

## Fixed
- **Campaigns**: Fixed an issue that failed to set an unlimited redemption limit for vouchers when setting default_voucher_redemption.quantity to null while updating a campaign.
- **Redemptions**: Fixed an issue that prevented rolling back a parent redemption which had a successful and a failed redemption.

</Update>

<Update label="November 24th, 2025" description="v20251119" rss={{ title: "November 24th release", description: "Payload designer" }}>

## Added

- **Payload Designer – Context-Based Examples**: The Payload Designer now shows example payloads that change automatically based on the selected trigger. Only variables relevant to the trigger type are displayed, making it easier to build and test payloads.
- **Payload Designer – Raw Payload Support**: You can now send raw webhook payloads. A new checkbox lets you switch between sending the full webhook payload or only the raw payload from the designer.
- **Payload Designer – Payload Preview**: A new preview panel shows example payload data. You can toggle the preview on or off for both default and custom payloads.

## Fixed

- **Lists**: Fixed an issue where several list views (such as Promotion Tiers and Promotion Stacks) did not refresh correctly after create, edit, or delete actions. Record counts, search results, and pagination now update correctly.
- **Events**: Fixed a bug where the *Performed By* and *Channel* fields were missing in event details when logs were unavailable. These fields are now always displayed.

</Update>

<Update label="November 19th, 2025" description="v20251114" rss={{ title: "November 19th release", description: "Logs export" }}>

## Added
- **Export Logs**: You can now export filtered API audit logs to CSV directly from the UI. All filters are supported.
- **Advanced filters for logs**: You can now filter logs by text in the request body and response body during export. Use one or both filters. Available on request for Enterprise customers.

## Improved
- **Segments**: The “Filtered Segment” name is now changed back to “Dynamic Segment” to match our standard terms.

## Fixed
- **Earning Rules**: Fixed an issue that blocked editing the time frame after setting an expiration date. You can now update all date fields correctly.

</Update>

<Update label="November 17th, 2025" description="v20251103" rss={{ title: "November 17th release", description: "Improvements to SAML login" }}>

## Improved
- **SAML**: For clients with enabled SAML login, the password setup process while creating a new account is now completely disabled as this step is redundant.

</Update>

<Update label="November 14th, 2025" description="v20251105" rss={{ title: "November 14th release", description: "Improvements and bug fixes to UI" }}>

## Improved

- **Show more**: The **Show more** component is now consistent across the app. You'll notice a unified click-to-open experience. It has also been introduced for Areas and Stores assignments, with a display limit and the remaining items accessible with the **Show more** button.
- **Payload designer**: Improved the Payload designer to correctly retain variables with `null` values when saving and reopening custom payloads.

## Fixed

- **Metadata**: Fixed an issue where dates in “array of dates” metadata fields were displayed incorrectly in pills when the project timezone differed from your local timezone. Dates now reflect the values you select, regardless of the timezone.
- **Time frame**:
  - Fixed an issue where the **Starts in X days** label for promotion tiers differed from the campaign label when daylight saving time or timezone offsets were applied. The display is now consistent.
  - Campaign start and expiration dates now consistently match your input, even during daylight saving time transitions.
- **Payload designer**: Payload designer now correctly saves empty arrays `[]` and empty objects `{}` in custom payloads.

</Update>

<Update label="November 6th, 2025" description="v20251024_k">

## Removed

- **Segments**: Removed the initial_sync_status property from responses in POST v1/segments and GET v1/segments/{segmentId} endpoints.

</Update>

<Update label="November 5th, 2025" description="v20251031">

## Added

### Passive segments

This change helps you manage customer segments more efficiently. It reduces noise from frequent profile updates and gives you better control over when segment events should be tracked.

Segments created from filters are now Passive by default. 

- Passive segments do not trigger join or leave events in a customer profile.

- Active segments still trigger these events.

- If a Passive segment is used in Earning Rules, Distributions, or Referral Tiers, it becomes active automatically.

- Existing Active segments are not affected.

### Read-only segments tab

A new Segments tab in the Customer Profile shows all segments a customer belongs to. This tab is read-only and includes search, pagination, and sorting.

### Edit passive segments

You can now edit conditions for Passive segments directly in the app. Once a segment becomes Active, it can no longer be edited.

### Drawers

Drawers now support a URL parameter to keep the opened item state after refresh or when sharing a link.

## Fixed

### Drawers

Fixed an issue where breadcrumb navigation didn’t close drawers for Metadata and Audit Logs. Clicking the breadcrumb now closes the drawer correctly.

### Metadata

Fixed an issue where a duplicate warning appeared for required metadata fields with predefined dictionary values.

</Update>

<Update label="October 31st, 2025" description="v20251029">

## Improved

### Filters

You can now filter resources by an exact date in date-type fields, making it easier to find what you need.

## Fixed

### Discounts

Fixed an issue where editing discounts with dynamic collections triggered extra validation.

### Demo Shop

Fixed an issue where Free Item Discount campaigns with the “always add new items” setting didn’t show the free item correctly in the cart. The free unit now appears as a separate line, matching the API response.

### Orders

Fixed an issue where products selected by source ID didn’t display correctly as resource links when creating an order.

### Rewards

Fixed an issue where the Related Object column in the Rewards table showed wrong information for rewards assigned to referral tiers.

### Loyalties

Fixed an issue where the Adjust points button was active for unpublished loyalty cards. It’s now disabled to prevent errors when adding points to cards without a holder.

### Redemptions

Fixed an issue where the pagination counter in order details counted units instead of order line items.

### Earning Rules

Fixed an issue where the points expiration label was unclear. It now says “Use campaign expiration rules” to better describe how it works.

</Update>

<Update label="October 29th, 2025" description="v20251024">

## Added

### Metadata

The updated metadata editor — once only in Customers and Rewards — is now available everywhere. You can now edit metadata consistently in campaigns, customers, products, orders, redemptions, and more.

## Fixed

### Approval Requests & Metadata

Improved error handling when metadata changes from a single value to an array. The system now validates schema changes correctly, approval requests no longer fail, and error messages are clearer.

</Update>

<Update label="October 24th, 2025" description="v20251014">

## Improved

### Table Usability

Tables now support horizontal scrolling. Key columns such as ID/Name, Status, and Actions stay fixed while you scroll, making it easier to view and compare data across wide tables.

### Product & SKU Display

The Product and SKU columns are now combined into one Name column for better clarity. If the item is an SKU, both the Product Name and SKU Name appear together.

</Update>

<Update label="October 16th, 2025" description="v20251007">

## Added

### Audit log

This version brings new filters and functionalities to Logs. Thanks to these changes, you can quickly find relevant logs for analytics or troubleshooting.

#### New filters

Users with the **Read events and technical logs** permission can now find data quicker in the Audit logs thanks to the new filters:

- **Endpoint** – Lists all logs for a specific endpoint, e.g. `POST_v1_vouchers_import_csv`.
- **User** – Lists all logs for actions performed by a given organization user. Requires **Access to Project's Users list** permission.
- **Server-side API key** – Lists all logs performed with a given server-side API key. The filter uses the key name, so the key itself is protected. Requires **Access Project Settings** permission.
- **Client-side API key** – Lists all logs performed with a given client-side API key. The filter uses the key name, so the key itself is protected. Requires **Access Project Settings** permission.

#### Export API logs – API endpoint

You can now export API logs in a CSV file using the `POST /v1/exports` (Create exports) endpoint.  
Pass `"exported_object": "api_log"` in the request body.

You can use the following parameters:

- **fields:** `"id"`, `"created_at"`, `"status"`, `"request_id"`, `"channel"`, `"method"`, `"endpoint"`, `"url"`, `"user_email"`, `"app_id"`, `"client_app_id"`, `"request_duration"`, `"request_body"`, `"response_body"`.
- `filters`: `created_at` (with `$before` and `$after` conditions), `status` (with `$is` and `$is_not` conditions), `channel` (with `$in`, `$not_in` conditions), `app_id` and `client_app_id` (both with `$in`, `$not_in`, `$is`, and `$is_not` conditions).
- **order:** `created_at` (ascending order), `-created_at` (descending order).

## Improved

### Audit logs

- Logs for imports now include a downloadable file that was used in the import.
- Audit log now shows the async action ID, if applicable.
- Async action details now return the corresponding audit log ID.
- The **Channel** filter now only shows channels that were used and lists used SDKs as a channel source.

## Fixed

- Campaign builder: Fixed an issue which prevented changing the redemption limit when editing a campaign.
- Async actions: `GET v1/async-actions/{id}` endpoint now returns the `user` and `log_id`.
- Product CSV import: Fixed an issue which caused incorrect update of metadata for products in collections.

</Update>

<Update label="October 14th, 2025" description="v20251003">

## Added

### Bundle Multiplication

[Bundle Multiplication](/build/product-bundles) is now available for all users. It determines how many times a bundle can be applied within a single order, based on the number of complete sets of bundled items a customer adds to their cart.

With bundle multiplication, the system automatically checks how many full bundles exist in the order and applies the discount that many times.

#### What gets multiplied

- The **discount value** (for example, a \$10 bundle discount becomes \$20 if two complete bundles are found).
- **Free items** or **discounted quantities** linked to the bundle.

#### Example scenarios

- “Buy 2 T-shirts, get 1 hat free.” → The more T-shirts customers buy, the more hats they receive.  
- “Buy a laptop and a mouse together for 10% off.” → Discount applies only to eligible products, up to the configured limit.  
- “Get 20% off every second coffee mug (max 3 bundles per order).” → Maximum eligible bundles limit the number of discounted sets.  
- “Buy 3 skincare products and pay only for 2.” → Item discount limit ensures only one item in each bundle is free.  
- “Bundle any 4 books and get \$10 off the whole order (up to \$50 total).” → Discount multiplies with each bundle up to the set cap.

### Bundle Multiplication

The **Discount Effect** can now be multiplied by the number of bundles in the cart.  
Each bundle increases either the **discount value** or the **discounted product limit**, depending on the configured Discount Effect, up to the maximum eligible bundles limit.

### Copy Bundle Button

Added an option to copy bundled items directly to discounted products with a single click.  
This feature works for all discount types except selected free product discounts.

### Discount Tab

Updated the **Discount** tab with clearer sections for **Bundled Items**, **Discounted Products**, and **Excluded Products** in a simplified, read-only layout.  
A **collection badge** now indicates when a resource belongs to a product collection.

### Bundle Discount Setup

Redesigned the setup flow for **bundle discounts**, making the configuration process more intuitive and streamlined.

## Fixed

### Discount wizard validation

Fixed an issue where validation in the **Discount Wizard** did not persist across steps, which could allow saving incomplete or empty discounts.

## Removed

### Timeframe

Removed the **Timeframe** section above Campaign and Voucher details, as this information is already displayed in its own dedicated section.

</Update>


<Update label="October 7th, 2025" description="v20250910">

### Time picker

The time picker has been updated to use a dropdown menu instead of a clock.
The dropdown provides options every 30 minutes, and any valid time can also be entered manually.
Some time inputs in metadata definitions are not yet affected by this change and still use the legacy picker.

## Fixed

### Onboarding

Fixed the issue where the Demoshop onboarding flow stopped at step 5, so it now continues smoothly through all 8 steps.

### Metadata

- Fixed the issue where negative numbers could not be used in customer metadata and filters; negative values are now supported.
- Fixed the issue where metadata definitions were sorted by name length instead of alphabetically.

### Payload designer

We have introduced the **Payload Designer** for webhook integrations.
It lets you choose between sending the full webhook payload or designing your own JSON structure with static values, dynamic Voucherify keys, and nested objects.
It solves the main limitation of the previous approach by giving you greater control and clarity when shaping webhook data.
The mapping will be visible in the `data` object in the webhook.

## Improved

### Support widget update

We’ve refreshed the look of the support widget in the Dashboard and introduced a new support link.
While the appearance is slightly different, you can continue to reach out to our support team in the same way as before.

## Added

### Earning rules

Added a message that appears when customers reach the 100-rule limit. To add a new rule, you must first delete the existing one.

### Verification

Added `org_id` field to the general tab in the My profile section. Users can use it for verification when requesting sensitive data.

## Improved

### Validation rules

Updated the discount campaigns and referral campaigns by renaming the "Validation Rules" tab to "Discount" and aligning its UI with the promotion tier. The tab now displays bundles, included and excluded products, and all application rules.

### Loyalty

Estimate how many loyalty points your customers will receive with a new endpoint:
`POST /v1/loyalties/{campaignId}/qualifications`.

See the sample request and response:

<CodeGroup>
```JSON Request
{  
    "customer": {  
        "source_id": "customerSourceID",  
        "metadata": {  
            "reason": "loyaltyQualifications"  
        }  
    },  
    "order": {  
        "id": "ord_113628fa0685537f99",  
        "metadata": {  
            "source": "qualifyPoints"  
        }  
    }
}
```
```JSON Response 200 OK
{  
    "campaign": {  
        "id": "camp_6hAtKbSF3iMj8wN8HjlvPuQG",  
        "name": "Loyalty-campaign",  
        "object": "campaign"  
    },  
    "points_estimation": 51  
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>

### Point estimation

This endpoint returns only an estimation, not a precise point value.

Also, this estimation works only for the Order paid earning rules. If a campaign includes tiers, mappings, and multiple earning rules, the calculation becomes more complex. During final calculation, a customer may change tiers and earn more or fewer points depending on other factors.
</Warning>

## Improved

### Voucher import

Added support for start_date and expiration_date when importing vouchers with CSV. You can add the respective columns to a CSV file to import vouchers with these parameters.

### Management API

Added limit and page query parameters to GET management/v1/projects/{projectId}/users endpoint. You can set a limit of a maximum of 100 results and paginate them.

## Fixed

### Product and SKU export

### Earning rules

Added an option to search earning rules by name directly in the campaign dashboard. The search works across all earning rules, is not case sensitive, and shows only rules that match your text.

## Improved

### Validation rules

Renamed “Redemption by code holder” rule to “Redemption only by code holder” to more accurately describe its function.

### JSON viewer

Improved how objects are shown in the dashboard. Empty objects and confusing property counts are no longer displayed, making the view clearer and easier to read.

### Stacking rules

We’ve added a new limit for Stackable Discounts API: Limits per category. You can now set a limit (up to 10) of stacked incentives for individual categories.

For example, if you have a three categories, Bronze, Silver, Gold, you can set up a limit of 2 for Silver, and 1 for Gold, while Bronze is limited by the Maximum count of valid promotions per category to apply in a request. This means that a maximum of 2 incentives from the Silver category and 1 from the Gold category can be validated or redeemed in one stackable API request.

### Loyalty programs

Fixed an issue that triggered updates to all earning rules and loyalty tiers (even when no campaign changes were made) while updating a campaign.

### Bundle 

Fixed an issue where creating a Bundle via API without specifying "type": "product_or_sku" caused the product not to be shown in the UI.

### Discount value

Fixed an issue that caused [object Object] to be displayed as a discount value in orders.

### Log in page

Fixed an issue that caused users to log in automatically after selecting the Read more button in the carousel.

## Added

### New expiration type for campaigns and earning rules

We’ve added support for `FIXED_DAY_OF_YEAR` expiration type in Earning Rules. This new option gives you more control over loyalty point expiration, because you can set an exact month and day. This is a perfect option for seasonal promotions, loyalty program resets, or end-of-year expirations. For example, you can set an expiration date of 31 December for all loyalty points earned during the Black Friday sales.

Also, to improve clarity, expiration descriptions now display with short month names and a clearer date format.

### New drawer view for distribution details

Distribution details now open in a drawer view across the app, including when accessed through a direct URL address.

## Added

### Stacking rules

We have added a new setting to Stacking rules: Sorting rule for grouped redeemables. You can now define a general order in which redeemables are applied when stacked discounts (validations or redemptions) include discounts with categories assigned to Joint and Exclusives.

This rule has two options:

- **Apply Joint categories last:** This is a default setting and the current behavior of the Stacking rules. In this scenario, Exclusive categories are applied first and then the Joint categories.
- **Apply Sorting rule to combined Joint and Exclusive categories:** This is a new setting. In this scenario, Stacking rules combine the discounts assigned to Joint and Exclusive categories into one group and apply the discounts according to the Sorting rule setting – request order or hierarchy.

### Refreshed UI for the Publications history tab inside the discount coupon campaign view

We've refreshed the UI for the Publication history tab inside the discount coupons campaign view to match the recent UI changes. The refreshed look provides a compact overview of key details matching our latest UI style for improved usability and a smoother experience.

## Fixed

### Validation rules

Fixed an issue that did not allow the use of negative values when creating validation rules based on number metadata fields.

### UI

Fixed an issue where voucher codes incorrectly appeared as 'no code' in the history tab following bulk publication in discount coupon campaigns.

### Filters

Incentive filtering in the Validations has been split into two separate filters for better usability:

- **Number of stacked incentives** – allows conditions such as 'has exactly', 'has more than', or 'has less than' to filter based on the number of applied incentives.
- **Incentive name** – uses the “includes” condition to filter by specific incentive names.

### Discounts - new value limits for products

<Note>
This feature can be enabled for you on demand. Contact [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support "Contact Voucherify Support site") to enable it.
</Note>

You can now limit the number of discounted item units in discount coupons and promotions. With these new limits, you can build a scenario where each of your customers can get for example only 2 discounted product units in total in a campaign and the whole campaign covers only 200 discounted product units – units sold above this limit will not be discounted.

The limits cover the following product discounts:

- Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit
- Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal
- New price: Apply the discount to item subtotal

You can set the limits for products, SKUs, or collections. The new value limits are:

- **Maximum units per customer in campaign:** limits the number of discounted item units that one customer can receive in a given campaign.
  For example, the limit is set to 2 for a T-shirt from the Adventure brand. One customer can only discount 2 units of this T-shirt.

- **Maximum units per campaign:** limits the number of discounted item units that all customers can receive in a given campaign.
  For example, there are 10 Adventure T-shirts that can be discounted. The 10 discounted T-shirts are available to all customers and the customer who buys the 11th T-shirt won’t receive a discount.

- **Maximum units per campaign for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that all customers can receive in a given campaign.
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the “Adventure-brand” collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters will be discounted. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

- **Maximum units per customer for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that one customer can receive.
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the “Adventure-brand” collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum one customer can get a discount on a maximum of 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

- **Maximum units per promotion tier:** limits the number of discounted item units that all customers can receive in a promotion tier.
  For example, there are 10 Adventure T-shirts that can be discounted. The 10 discounted T-shirts are available to all customers and the customer who buys the 11th T-shirt won’t receive a discount under a given promotion tier.

- **Maximum units per customer in promotion tier:** limits the number of discounted item units that one customer can receive in a given promotion tier.
  For example, the limit is set to 2 for a T-shirt from the Adventure brand. One customer can only discount 2 units of this T-shirt under a given promotion tier.

- **Maximum units per promotion tier for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that all customers can receive in a given promotion tier.
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the “Adventure-brand” collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters will be discounted. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units under a given promotion tier.

- **Maximum units per customer in promotion tier for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that one customer can receive in a given promotion tier.
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the “Adventure-brand” collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum one customer can get a discount on a maximum of 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

All of the new limits can be combined with dynamic formulas. A dynamic formula determines the number of units that’s covered by the limit.

The limits can be configured in the Dashboard and through the API – validation rules.

### Loyalty campaigns

You can now define multiple products and collections in the following rules in the Order has been paid earning rule, proportional calculation:
Pre-discount amount spent on items, Amount spent on items, Quantity of items in the cart.

Multiple products and collections are also supported in the API. A new parameter called applicable_to can be added to the following PROPORTIONAL earning rules:
`ORDER_ITEMS_QUANTITY`, `ORDER_ITEMS_AMOUNT`, `ORDER_ITEMS_SUBTOTAL_AMOUNT`.

The parameter replaces the object and id fields with an array of objects, which contain an id and an object with a type product, sku, or products_collection.

You can also define a dynamic formula for earning loyalty points. The configuration works in a similar way to a dynamic discount formula.

The dynamic formula is also supported in the API. There’s a new points_formula field that defines the dynamic calculation of loyalty points.

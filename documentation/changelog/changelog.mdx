<Update label="25th Nov 2025" description="v20251124" rss={{ title: "November 25th release", description: "New customer segment endpoints" }}>

## Added

This version brings several new features to Voucherify.

### Webhooks

You can now monitor changes to your customer profiles with the new webhook covering the `customer.updated` event. You can find this webhook in Project settings. This webhook is not triggered by bulk customer updates, like import customers with a CSV file, update customers in bulk, or update customers' metadata in bulk.

### Customer segments
This version brings a couple of new features to customer segments.

We've added a new API endpoint GET v1/segments to list your segments. You can use the following query parameters:
- `limit` with a maximum value of 100
- `order` with `created_at` (ascending) and `-created_at` (descending) values
- `filters` with `id`, `type`, `name`, `created_at` values
- `starting_after` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `ids` with an ID as a string or an array of ID strings

Additionally, there's another new API endpoint for monitoring activities in the segment, GET `v1/segments/{id}/activities`. You can list the following events related to that segment:
- created
- updated
- activated
- filters_updated

You can use the following query parameters:

- `limit` with a maximum value of 100
- `order` with `created_at` (ascending) and `-created_at` (descending) values
- `starting_after` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `starting_after_id` with an activity ID; it returns activities created after this activity.
- `start_date` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `end_date` with an ISO 8601 timestamp value
- `type` with an event type name
- `category` with an event category

## Fixed
- **Campaigns**: Fixed an issue that failed to set an unlimited redemption limit for vouchers when setting default_voucher_redemption.quantity to null while updating a campaign.
- **Redemptions**: Fixed an issue that prevented rolling back a parent redemption which had a successful and a failed redemption.

</Update>

<Update label="November 24th, 2025" description="v20251119" rss={{ title: "November 24th release", description: "Payload designer" }}>

## Added

- **Payload Designer – Context-Based Examples**: The Payload Designer now shows example payloads that change automatically based on the selected trigger. Only variables relevant to the trigger type are displayed, making it easier to build and test payloads.
- **Payload Designer – Raw Payload Support**: You can now send raw webhook payloads. A new checkbox lets you switch between sending the full webhook payload or only the raw payload from the designer.
- **Payload Designer – Payload Preview**: A new preview panel shows example payload data. You can toggle the preview on or off for both default and custom payloads.

## Fixed

- **Lists**: Fixed an issue where several list views (such as Promotion Tiers and Promotion Stacks) did not refresh correctly after create, edit, or delete actions. Record counts, search results, and pagination now update correctly.
- **Events**: Fixed a bug where the *Performed By* and *Channel* fields were missing in event details when logs were unavailable. These fields are now always displayed.

</Update>

<Update label="November 19th, 2025" description="v20251114" rss={{ title: "November 19th release", description: "Logs export" }}>

## Added
- **Export Logs**: You can now export filtered API audit logs to CSV directly from the UI. All filters are supported.
- **Advanced filters for logs**: You can now filter logs by text in the request body and response body during export. Use one or both filters. Available on request for Enterprise customers.

## Improved
- **Segments**: The “Filtered Segment” name is now changed back to “Dynamic Segment” to match our standard terms.

## Fixed
- **Earning Rules**: Fixed an issue that blocked editing the time frame after setting an expiration date. You can now update all date fields correctly.

</Update>

<Update label="November 17th, 2025" description="v20251103" rss={{ title: "November 17th release", description: "Improvements to SAML login" }}>

## Improved
- **SAML**: For clients with enabled SAML login, the password setup process while creating a new account is now completely disabled as this step is redundant.

</Update>

<Update label="November 14th, 2025" description="v20251105" rss={{ title: "November 14th release", description: "Improvements and bug fixes to UI" }}>

## Improved

- **Show more**: The **Show more** component is now consistent across the app. You'll notice a unified click-to-open experience. It has also been introduced for Areas and Stores assignments, with a display limit and the remaining items accessible with the **Show more** button.
- **Payload designer**: Improved the Payload designer to correctly retain variables with `null` values when saving and reopening custom payloads.

## Fixed

- **Metadata**: Fixed an issue where dates in “array of dates” metadata fields were displayed incorrectly in pills when the project timezone differed from your local timezone. Dates now reflect the values you select, regardless of the timezone.
- **Time frame**:
  - Fixed an issue where the **Starts in X days** label for promotion tiers differed from the campaign label when daylight saving time or timezone offsets were applied. The display is now consistent.
  - Campaign start and expiration dates now consistently match your input, even during daylight saving time transitions.
- **Payload designer**: Payload designer now correctly saves empty arrays `[]` and empty objects `{}` in custom payloads.

</Update>

<Update label="November 6th, 2025" description="v20251024_k">

## Removed

- **Segments**: Removed the initial_sync_status property from responses in POST v1/segments and GET v1/segments/{segmentId} endpoints.

</Update>

<Update label="November 5th, 2025" description="v20251031">

## Added

### Passive segments

This change helps you manage customer segments more efficiently. It reduces noise from frequent profile updates and gives you better control over when segment events should be tracked.

Segments created from filters are now Passive by default. 

- Passive segments do not trigger join or leave events in a customer profile.

- Active segments still trigger these events.

- If a Passive segment is used in Earning Rules, Distributions, or Referral Tiers, it becomes active automatically.

- Existing Active segments are not affected.

### Read-only segments tab

A new Segments tab in the Customer Profile shows all segments a customer belongs to. This tab is read-only and includes search, pagination, and sorting.

### Edit passive segments

You can now edit conditions for Passive segments directly in the app. Once a segment becomes Active, it can no longer be edited.

### Drawers

Drawers now support a URL parameter to keep the opened item state after refresh or when sharing a link.

## Fixed

### Drawers

Fixed an issue where breadcrumb navigation didn’t close drawers for Metadata and Audit Logs. Clicking the breadcrumb now closes the drawer correctly.

### Metadata

Fixed an issue where a duplicate warning appeared for required metadata fields with predefined dictionary values.

</Update>

<Update label="October 31st, 2025" description="v20251029">

## Improved

### Filters

You can now filter resources by an exact date in date-type fields, making it easier to find what you need.

## Fixed

### Discounts

Fixed an issue where editing discounts with dynamic collections triggered extra validation.

### Demo Shop

Fixed an issue where Free Item Discount campaigns with the “always add new items” setting didn’t show the free item correctly in the cart. The free unit now appears as a separate line, matching the API response.

### Orders

Fixed an issue where products selected by source ID didn’t display correctly as resource links when creating an order.

### Rewards

Fixed an issue where the Related Object column in the Rewards table showed wrong information for rewards assigned to referral tiers.

### Loyalties

Fixed an issue where the Adjust points button was active for unpublished loyalty cards. It’s now disabled to prevent errors when adding points to cards without a holder.

### Redemptions

Fixed an issue where the pagination counter in order details counted units instead of order line items.

### Earning Rules

Fixed an issue where the points expiration label was unclear. It now says “Use campaign expiration rules” to better describe how it works.

</Update>

<Update label="October 29th, 2025" description="v20251024">

## Added

### Metadata

The updated metadata editor — once only in Customers and Rewards — is now available everywhere. You can now edit metadata consistently in campaigns, customers, products, orders, redemptions, and more.

## Fixed

### Approval Requests & Metadata

Improved error handling when metadata changes from a single value to an array. The system now validates schema changes correctly, approval requests no longer fail, and error messages are clearer.

</Update>

<Update label="October 24th, 2025" description="v20251014">

## Improved

### Table Usability

Tables now support horizontal scrolling. Key columns such as ID/Name, Status, and Actions stay fixed while you scroll, making it easier to view and compare data across wide tables.

### Product & SKU Display

The Product and SKU columns are now combined into one Name column for better clarity. If the item is an SKU, both the Product Name and SKU Name appear together.

</Update>

<Update label="October 16th, 2025" description="v20251007">

## Added

### Audit log

This version brings new filters and functionalities to Logs. Thanks to these changes, you can quickly find relevant logs for analytics or troubleshooting.

#### New filters

Users with the **Read events and technical logs** permission can now find data quicker in the Audit logs thanks to the new filters:

- **Endpoint** – Lists all logs for a specific endpoint, e.g. `POST_v1_vouchers_import_csv`.
- **User** – Lists all logs for actions performed by a given organization user. Requires **Access to Project's Users list** permission.
- **Server-side API key** – Lists all logs performed with a given server-side API key. The filter uses the key name, so the key itself is protected. Requires **Access Project Settings** permission.
- **Client-side API key** – Lists all logs performed with a given client-side API key. The filter uses the key name, so the key itself is protected. Requires **Access Project Settings** permission.

#### Export API logs – API endpoint

You can now export API logs in a CSV file using the `POST /v1/exports` (Create exports) endpoint.  
Pass `"exported_object": "api_log"` in the request body.

You can use the following parameters:

- **fields:** `"id"`, `"created_at"`, `"status"`, `"request_id"`, `"channel"`, `"method"`, `"endpoint"`, `"url"`, `"user_email"`, `"app_id"`, `"client_app_id"`, `"request_duration"`, `"request_body"`, `"response_body"`.
- `filters`: `created_at` (with `$before` and `$after` conditions), `status` (with `$is` and `$is_not` conditions), `channel` (with `$in`, `$not_in` conditions), `app_id` and `client_app_id` (both with `$in`, `$not_in`, `$is`, and `$is_not` conditions).
- **order:** `created_at` (ascending order), `-created_at` (descending order).

## Improved

### Audit logs

- Logs for imports now include a downloadable file that was used in the import.
- Audit log now shows the async action ID, if applicable.
- Async action details now return the corresponding audit log ID.
- The **Channel** filter now only shows channels that were used and lists used SDKs as a channel source.

## Fixed

- Campaign builder: Fixed an issue which prevented changing the redemption limit when editing a campaign.
- Async actions: `GET v1/async-actions/{id}` endpoint now returns the `user` and `log_id`.
- Product CSV import: Fixed an issue which caused incorrect update of metadata for products in collections.

</Update>

<Update label="October 14th, 2025" description="v20251003">

## Added

### Bundle Multiplication

[Bundle Multiplication](https://support.voucherify.io/article/558-product-bundles) is now available for all users. It determines how many times a bundle can be applied within a single order, based on the number of complete sets of bundled items a customer adds to their cart.

With bundle multiplication, the system automatically checks how many full bundles exist in the order and applies the discount that many times.

#### What gets multiplied

- The **discount value** (for example, a \$10 bundle discount becomes \$20 if two complete bundles are found).
- **Free items** or **discounted quantities** linked to the bundle.

#### Example scenarios

- “Buy 2 T-shirts, get 1 hat free.” → The more T-shirts customers buy, the more hats they receive.  
- “Buy a laptop and a mouse together for 10% off.” → Discount applies only to eligible products, up to the configured limit.  
- “Get 20% off every second coffee mug (max 3 bundles per order).” → Maximum eligible bundles limit the number of discounted sets.  
- “Buy 3 skincare products and pay only for 2.” → Item discount limit ensures only one item in each bundle is free.  
- “Bundle any 4 books and get \$10 off the whole order (up to \$50 total).” → Discount multiplies with each bundle up to the set cap.

### Bundle Multiplication

The **Discount Effect** can now be multiplied by the number of bundles in the cart.  
Each bundle increases either the **discount value** or the **discounted product limit**, depending on the configured Discount Effect, up to the maximum eligible bundles limit.

### Copy Bundle Button

Added an option to copy bundled items directly to discounted products with a single click.  
This feature works for all discount types except selected free product discounts.

### Discount Tab

Updated the **Discount** tab with clearer sections for **Bundled Items**, **Discounted Products**, and **Excluded Products** in a simplified, read-only layout.  
A **collection badge** now indicates when a resource belongs to a product collection.

### Bundle Discount Setup

Redesigned the setup flow for **bundle discounts**, making the configuration process more intuitive and streamlined.

## Fixed

### Discount wizard validation

Fixed an issue where validation in the **Discount Wizard** did not persist across steps, which could allow saving incomplete or empty discounts.

## Removed

### Timeframe

Removed the **Timeframe** section above Campaign and Voucher details, as this information is already displayed in its own dedicated section.

</Update>


<Update label="October 7th, 2025" description="v20250910">

## Added

### Areas and stores in the Management API

Added new endpoints for managing areas and area stores with the Management API. The endpoints allow you to:

- List areas in your project: `GET /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas`
- Get details about a specific area: `GET /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{id}`
- Create a new area: `POST /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas`
- Update an existing area: `PUT /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{id}`
- Delete an area: `DELETE /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{id}`
- List all area stores: `GET /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores`
- Get a specific area store: `GET /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores/{storeId}`
- Create a news area store: `POST /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores`
- Update an existing area store: `PUT /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores/{storeId}`
- Delete an existing area store: `DELETE /management/v1/projects/{projectId}/areas/{areaId}/stores/{storeId}`

## Improved

### Areas and stores

- Improved navigation when selecting areas, stores, and all stores.
- Improved permission checking for Areas & Stores features, ensuring proper access control.
- Added areas and stores filters to the campaign list.

## Fixed

### Areas and stores

- Fixed an issue which failed to copy areas and stores assignments when cloning a campaign.
- Fixed an issue which failed store assignments to display in area details view.
- Fixed an issue which allowed the users without required permissions to see areas and stores tabs.
- Fixed an issue which prevented users from creating promotion campaigns.
- Fixed an issue which allowed restricted users to add and publish vouchers for campaigns that the restricted users could only view.

</Update>

<Update label="October 3rd, 2025" description="v20250930">

## Improved

### Time picker

The time picker has been updated to use a dropdown menu instead of a clock.
The dropdown provides options every 30 minutes, and any valid time can also be entered manually.
Some time inputs in metadata definitions are not yet affected by this change and still use the legacy picker.

## Fixed

### Onboarding

Fixed the issue where the Demoshop onboarding flow stopped at step 5, so it now continues smoothly through all 8 steps.

### Metadata

- Fixed the issue where negative numbers could not be used in customer metadata and filters; negative values are now supported.
- Fixed the issue where metadata definitions were sorted by name length instead of alphabetically.

</Update>

<Update label="September 29th, 2025" description="v20250924">

## Added

### Payload designer

We have introduced the **Payload Designer** for webhook integrations.
It lets you choose between sending the full webhook payload or designing your own JSON structure with static values, dynamic Voucherify keys, and nested objects.
It solves the main limitation of the previous approach by giving you greater control and clarity when shaping webhook data.
The mapping will be visible in the `data` object in the webhook.

## Improved

### Support widget update

We’ve refreshed the look of the support widget in the Dashboard and introduced a new support link.
While the appearance is slightly different, you can continue to reach out to our support team in the same way as before.

</Update>

<Update label="September 23rd, 2025" description="v20250911">

## Added

### Earning rules

Added a message that appears when customers reach the 100-rule limit. To add a new rule, you must first delete the existing one.

### Verification

Added `org_id` field to the general tab in the My profile section. Users can use it for verification when requesting sensitive data.

## Improved

### Validation rules

Updated the discount campaigns and referral campaigns by renaming the "Validation Rules" tab to "Discount" and aligning its UI with the promotion tier. The tab now displays bundles, included and excluded products, and all application rules.

### Delete resources

Updated the resource delete dialog with a clearer, simplified design. Users can now choose between moving a resource to the bin or deleting it permanently using a streamlined layout.

## Fixed

### Vouchers

Fixed the issue where the loader kept spinning when manually adding a voucher to a campaign. The interface now shows a clear message and remains usable without errors.

</Update>

<Update label="September 17th, 2025" description="v20250905">

## Added

### Loyalty

Estimate how many loyalty points your customers will receive with a new endpoint:
`POST /v1/loyalties/{campaignId}/qualifications`.

See the sample request and response:

<CodeGroup>
```JSON Request
{  
    "customer": {  
        "source_id": "customerSourceID",  
        "metadata": {  
            "reason": "loyaltyQualifications"  
        }  
    },  
    "order": {  
        "id": "ord_113628fa0685537f99",  
        "metadata": {  
            "source": "qualifyPoints"  
        }  
    }
}
```
```JSON Response 200 OK
{  
    "campaign": {  
        "id": "camp_6hAtKbSF3iMj8wN8HjlvPuQG",  
        "name": "Loyalty-campaign",  
        "object": "campaign"  
    },  
    "points_estimation": 51  
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>

### Point estimation

This endpoint returns only an estimation, not a precise point value.

Also, this estimation works only for the Order paid earning rules. If a campaign includes tiers, mappings, and multiple earning rules, the calculation becomes more complex. During final calculation, a customer may change tiers and earn more or fewer points depending on other factors.
</Warning>

## Improved

### Voucher import

Added support for start_date and expiration_date when importing vouchers with CSV. You can add the respective columns to a CSV file to import vouchers with these parameters.

### Management API

Added limit and page query parameters to GET management/v1/projects/{projectId}/users endpoint. You can set a limit of a maximum of 100 results and paginate them.

## Fixed

### Product and SKU export

Fixed a bug which prevented a notification from being sent and displayed in the app when a product or SKU export was finished.

</Update>

<Update label="September 11th, 2025" description="v20250828">

## Added

### Export

Export products & SKUs directly from the dashboard!
Grab all items or just your filtered view in seconds — no API needed. Files are ready in Exports in the Audit log for instant download. This makes sharing data or prepping lists for campaigns faster than ever, right from the dashboard.

### Earning rules

Added an option to search earning rules by name directly in the campaign dashboard. The search works across all earning rules, is not case sensitive, and shows only rules that match your text.

## Improved

### Validation rules

Renamed “Redemption by code holder” rule to “Redemption only by code holder” to more accurately describe its function.

### JSON viewer

Improved how objects are shown in the dashboard. Empty objects and confusing property counts are no longer displayed, making the view clearer and easier to read.

## Fixed

### Export

Fixed an issue where users without permission to export publication or redemption data could still see export buttons on the corresponding lists.

### Loyalty

Fixed an issue where users could not put 0 to ‘Months after earning activity rule’.

</Update>

<Update label="September 3rd, 2025" description="v20250804">

## Hotfix

### Webhooks

Fixed a bug which caused `VOUCHER.GIFT.TRANSACTION.CREATED` and `VOUCHER.LOYALTY_CARD.PENDING_POINTS.UPDATED` not to appear in Project settings and in the filters in Webhook send outs in the Audit log.

</Update>

<Update label="September 2nd, 2025" description="v20250804">

## Added

### Stacking rules

We’ve added a new limit for Stackable Discounts API: Limits per category. You can now set a limit (up to 10) of stacked incentives for individual categories.

For example, if you have a three categories, Bronze, Silver, Gold, you can set up a limit of 2 for Silver, and 1 for Gold, while Bronze is limited by the Maximum count of valid promotions per category to apply in a request. This means that a maximum of 2 incentives from the Silver category and 1 from the Gold category can be validated or redeemed in one stackable API request.

## Improved

### Segments

Changed the name of Dynamic segments to Active.

## Fixed

### Audit logs

Fixed an issue which caused incorrect filtering for the API value with the “not in” condition for Channel.

Fixed an issue that caused the loyalty balance to reset after changing the time frame in the loyalty card.

</Update>

<Update label="September 1st, 2025" description="v20250820">

## Improved

### Dynamic discount

Added support for order item quantity, price, and product metadata in the "Amount Discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit".

## Fixed

### Loyalty programs

Fixed an issue that triggered updates to all earning rules and loyalty tiers (even when no campaign changes were made) while updating a campaign.

### Bundle 

Fixed an issue where creating a Bundle via API without specifying "type": "product_or_sku" caused the product not to be shown in the UI.

### Discount value

Fixed an issue that caused [object Object] to be displayed as a discount value in orders.

### Log in page

Fixed an issue that caused users to log in automatically after selecting the Read more button in the carousel.

</Update>

<Update label="August 21st, 2025" description="v20250813">

## Added

### New expiration type for campaigns and earning rules

We’ve added support for `FIXED_DAY_OF_YEAR` expiration type in Earning Rules. This new option gives you more control over loyalty point expiration, because you can set an exact month and day. This is a perfect option for seasonal promotions, loyalty program resets, or end-of-year expirations. For example, you can set an expiration date of 31 December for all loyalty points earned during the Black Friday sales.

Also, to improve clarity, expiration descriptions now display with short month names and a clearer date format.

### New drawer view for distribution details

Distribution details now open in a drawer view across the app, including when accessed through a direct URL address. The drawer includes complete distribution data, tabs, status controls, and a redesigned actions menu. Access is available to users with Read Distributions and Publications permissions.

## Improved

Improved the analytic tab to look consistent with other drawers across the app.

## Fixed

### Audit log

The filter label for Webhook send outs has been updated. The field previously shown as ID is now displayed as send out ID.

### Publications

Fixed an issue where users could view the publication history tab without proper permission.

### Stacking rules

Fixed an issue that caused stacking rules to be visible to users without the proper permission.

</Update>

<Update label="August 13th, 2025" description="v20250805">

## Improved

### Rewritten the ResourceLink component to the new Angular version.

We rewrote the ResourceLink component to the new Angular version, ensuring resource displays and tooltips are now consistent across the app.
We also made detail navigation work smoothly—opening in drawers or new tabs with our new drawer layouts.

## Fixed

### Approvals

- Fixed an issue where voucher details were missing in the approval request preview when multiple vouchers were selected.
- Fixed an issue which caused the campaign templates not to work correctly with approval requests.

### Custom events

Fixed custom event schema filters so they now update correctly when the condition changes.

### Distributions

Fixed an issue where changing the trigger for the distribution caused the campaign assignment to reset and allowed saving the distribution without a campaign assigned.

### Drawers

Fixed an issue that caused products from static collections to open in the same window instead of a new tab.

### Earning rules

Fixed an issue that caused a collection ID to be displayed instead of its name when multiple products or collections were selected.

### Referral campaigns

Fixed a bug which caused the criteria in the Custom conversion event to change upon saving.

### ResourceLink

Fixed an issue that caused the validation rule's name in the resource link not to refresh automatically after editing.

### User interface

Adjusted spacing in the campaign view between the tabs and the timeframe.

### Loyalty programs

Fixed an issue that triggered updates to all loyalty cards (even when no campaign changes were made) while updating a campaign.

</Update>

<Update label="August 7th, 2025" description="v20250729">

## Added

### Stacking rules

We have added a new setting to Stacking rules: Sorting rule for grouped redeemables. You can now define a general order in which redeemables are applied when stacked discounts (validations or redemptions) include discounts with categories assigned to Joint and Exclusives.

This rule has two options:

- **Apply Joint categories last:** This is a default setting and the current behavior of the Stacking rules. In this scenario, Exclusive categories are applied first and then the Joint categories.
- **Apply Sorting rule to combined Joint and Exclusive categories:** This is a new setting. In this scenario, Stacking rules combine the discounts assigned to Joint and Exclusive categories into one group and apply the discounts according to the Sorting rule setting – request order or hierarchy.

</Update>

## Added

### Refreshed UI for the Publications history tab inside the discount coupon campaign view

We've refreshed the UI for the Publication history tab inside the discount coupons campaign view to match the recent UI changes. The refreshed look provides a compact overview of key details matching our latest UI style for improved usability and a smoother experience.

## Fixed

### Validation rules

Fixed an issue that did not allow the use of negative values when creating validation rules based on number metadata fields.

### UI

Fixed an issue where voucher codes incorrectly appeared as 'no code' in the history tab following bulk publication in discount coupon campaigns.

### Filters

Incentive filtering in the Validations has been split into two separate filters for better usability:

- **Number of stacked incentives** – allows conditions such as 'has exactly', 'has more than', or 'has less than' to filter based on the number of applied incentives.
- **Incentive name** – uses the “includes” condition to filter by specific incentive names.

</Update>

<Update label="July 30th, 2025" description="v20250725">

## Added

### Refreshed UI for Voucher tabs inside the Campaign view

We've refreshed the UI for Vouchers, Referral codes, and Loyalty cards tabs inside the Campaign detail view to match the recent UI changes. The new tabs provide a compact overview of key details matching our latest UI style for improved usability and a smoother experience.

### Refreshed Drawer Layout for Segments and Collections

We’ve updated the UI for drawers used in Customer Segments and Product Collections, delivering a cleaner and more consistent experience.
This update also includes enhancements to breadcrumb navigation links, ensuring better usability and clarity.

## Fixed

### Approvals

- Fixed an issue where the non-existent record with draft status briefly appeared before the page loaded the approvals list.
- Fixed an issue where users with limited permissions could not delete vouchers with an approval request.

### Import

Fixed an issue where the redeemed amount property appeared during the field mapping step when importing referral or discount vouchers. The redeemed amount property is not relevant for these voucher types.

### UI

Fixed an issue where a segment and collection drawer could not open in a new tab from the segments and collections list view respectively.

### Discounts - new value limits for products

<Note>
This feature can be enabled for you on demand. Contact [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support "Contact Voucherify Support site") to enable it.
</Note>

You can now limit the number of discounted item units in discount coupons and promotions. With these new limits, you can build a scenario where each of your customers can get for example only 2 discounted product units in total in a campaign and the whole campaign covers only 200 discounted product units – units sold above this limit will not be discounted.

The limits cover the following product discounts:

- Amount discount: Apply the full discount to each item unit
- Percent discount: Apply the discount to item subtotal
- New price: Apply the discount to item subtotal

You can set the limits for products, SKUs, or collections. The new value limits are:

- **Maximum units per customer in campaign:** limits the number of discounted item units that one customer can receive in a given campaign.
  For example, the limit is set to 2 for a T-shirt from the Adventure brand. One customer can only discount 2 units of this T-shirt.

- **Maximum units per campaign:** limits the number of discounted item units that all customers can receive in a given campaign.

- **Maximum units per campaign for a product in a collection:** limits the number of discounted item units of a given product in a collection that all customers can receive in a given campaign.
  For example, the limit is set to 5 for the “Adventure-brand” collection consisting of T-shirts, beanies, and posters; this means that maximum 5 T-shirts, 5 beanies, and 5 posters will be discounted. The limit isn't split between products; each product has its own limit of 5 item units.

- **Maximum units per customer in promotion tier:** limits the number of discounted item units that one customer can receive in a given promotion tier.

All of the new limits can be combined with dynamic formulas. A dynamic formula determines the number of units that’s covered by the limit.

The limits can be configured in the Dashboard and through the API – validation rules.

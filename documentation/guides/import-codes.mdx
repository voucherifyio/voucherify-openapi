In Voucherify, you can import legacy coupon codes, for example when you migrate the codes from another tool. After a successful import, the uploaded codes will be recognized as valid and inherit the discount definition from a given campaign.

There are two ways to import codes into Voucherify:

* programmable,
* with the import tool in the Voucherify Dashboard.

## Programmable import through the API

The programmable mode supports both the JSON and CSV payloads. There are four endpoints that handle the import of:

* Generic (standalone) vouchers: [JSON](/api-reference/vouchers/import-vouchers), [CSV](/api-reference/vouchers/import-vouchers-using-csv).
* Vouchers assigned to a given campaign: [JSON](/api-reference/campaigns/import-vouchers-to-campaign), [CSV](/api-reference/campaigns/import-vouchers-to-campaign-by-csv).

<Info>

You can upload up to 100,000 codes to a campaign, as a campaign can have up to 100,000 codes by default.

Also, the request can include up to **10 MB** of data; this means both JSON data or a CSV file.

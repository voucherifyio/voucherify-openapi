Only the **Account Owner** can manage subscription and billing settings. These options are available in **Team Settings > Subscription**.

## Subscription lifecycle

### Trial period

Every Voucherify account starts with a **60-day free trial**. During this time, you can:

- Use a free **Sandbox project** for testing.
- Explore a demo shop.
- Test the Voucherify API.

<Note>
After upgrading to a paid plan, the Sandbox project remains available and does not count toward your project limit. You can continue using it as a testing environment, and your existing data will not be reset.
</Note>

### Continue after the trial

To continue using Voucherify after the trial ends:

1. Go to **Team Settings > Subscription**.
2. Click **Create Subscription** and choose a plan.
3. Enter billing information and credit card details.
4. Click **Create**.

Your billing cycle starts on the day you confirm the subscription.

### Update your pricing plan

You can upgrade your plan at any time.

1. Go to **Team Settings > Subscription**.
2. Click **Change plan**.
3. Confirm billing and payment details.

If you need custom limits or additional features such as the Management API or Areas and Stores, contact [Voucherify team](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support) about the Enterprise plan.

Validation rules define the conditions that must be met to successfully redeem incentives, earn loyalty points, or trigger distributions in Voucherify. All validation logic is configured using the **validation rules builder**.

## Accessing the builder

You can open the validation rules builder from multiple places in the dashboard:

- **Campaign manager**  
  In the campaign creation process. Rules created here are automatically assigned to the campaign.

- **Campaign details**  
  Open an existing campaign and go to **rules** tab.

- **Validation rules manager**  
  Available in **campaign hub** > **validation rules**. This option lets you create reusable rules for future use across campaigns.

<Note>

When creating rules in the **validation rules manager**, you must first select a **context**. The context determines which rule types are available and is recommended for advanced use cases.

</Note>

## How to build a validation rule

Follow these steps to create or edit validation logic using the builder pop-over.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name the rule">
    Open the builder and enter a **name**. If left empty, Voucherify generates a default name based on the configured conditions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add rules">
    Click **Add rules** to choose conditions from available categories:
    - **Audience** – Customer segments or customer metadata  
    - **Products** – Specific products, SKUs, or collections  
    - **Prices & quantities** – Order value, item quantity, or price thresholds  
    - **Metadata** – Custom order, redemption, or publication attributes  
    - **Budget & redemptions** – Usage limits or campaign spend restrictions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define operators and conditions">
    For each rule, select operators such as *is*, *is more than*, *after*, or *contains*.

    <Tip>
      You can add multiple conditions within a single rule to refine the logic.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure junctions and brackets">
    Combine rules using logical connectors:
    - **AND** – All rules must be met  
    - **OR** – At least one rule must be met  

    Use **brackets** to group conditions. You can nest rules by dragging them into bracket groups.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set error messages">
    Click **add error message** to define a custom message returned in the API response when this specific rule is not met.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **save** to finish the creation process. The rule is assigned to the campaign or saved in the validation rules manager.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>

Available rule types depend on where the rule is created and, in the validation rules manager, on the selected context.

</Note>

## Using existing validation rules

In the campaign manager and campaign details, you can:

- Create a new validation rule
- Select an existing validation rule
- Clone and edit an existing rule
- View assigned rules using **show rules**
- Remove an assigned validation rule

Changes made to assigned rules are applied immediately.

## Validation rules and product discounts

For **product discounts**, Voucherify automatically creates a validation rule that includes all discounted products.

<Warning>

This auto-generated validation rule cannot be removed from the campaign in the campaign manager or campaign details. You can, however, edit the rule to add or remove conditions.

</Warning>

## Managing error messages

When a validation fails, Voucherify can return custom feedback through API responses.

### Validation rule error messages

You can define a custom error message for each validation rule. This message is returned when that specific rule is violated.

**Example:**  
“This promotion is only available for 1-year anniversary members.”

### Fallback error message

You can define a **fallback error message** that is returned when a validation rule fails and no rule-specific message is configured.

### Standard error messages

Standard errors are application-defined (for example, *voucher expired* or *quantity exceeded*). Voucherify supports translating a fixed set of standard error messages.

To customize standard error messages:

1. Go to **project settings** > **error messages**
2. Click **create new translations group**
3. Select **redemption & validation**
4. Add a locale and define custom text
5. Click **save**

<Warning>

Only one translation group is supported per project. You cannot define multiple languages simultaneously.

</Warning>

<Note>

If no validation rule error message and no fallback message are defined, the API response may not include the `error` object for validation rule violations.

</Note>

## Additional configuration options

Within the builder, you can further refine rules using:

- **Add subrule** – Available only for **any order item** and **every order item** rules  
- **Duplicate rule** – Creates a copy of the selected rule  
- **Rearrange rules** – Drag and drop rules to reorder them  

After moving a rule, an **AND** junction is added automatically and rule numbering updates.

Project settings let you control how a Voucherify project works. Here you can manage basic project details, security, branding, data schemas, usage limits, and advanced options.

To open Project settings, go to the **Home** section in the side panel and select **Project settings**.

## General

The **General** tab contains the main configuration for your project.

### Application information

This section shows basic information about the project.

- **Application name**: The name of your Voucherify project.
- **Description**: A short description of the project purpose.
- **Region**: The geographic region where the project operates.
- **Time zone**: The default time zone used for dates and expiration rules.
- **Currency**: The currency shown in the dashboard.
- **API version**: The API version used by the project.
- **API endpoint**: The base URL for API requests.
- **Default international dialing prefix**: Used when a customer is added without a phone prefix.
- **Advanced code settings**: The default character set used to generate voucher codes.
- **Case-sensitive voucher codes**: Defines whether uppercase and lowercase letters create different codes.

<Warning>
Case sensitivity can be set only during project creation and cannot be changed later.
</Warning>

After changing the project currency, log out and log in again to apply the change.

### Project members

This section lists all users assigned to the project, along with their roles and access status.  
Account Owners manage users and roles in **Team settings**.

### Email settings

Email settings allow you to send emails from your own domain.  
To use a custom sender address, you must verify the domain. This helps improve email delivery and trust.

### Webhooks

Webhooks let you send real-time data from Voucherify to your systems.  
You can add webhook URLs, check their status, and manage active endpoints.

### Application keys

This section shows API keys used to connect with Voucherify.

- **Application keys**: Used for server-side API calls.
- **Integration keys**: Used for specific integrations with limited access.
- **Client-side keys**: Used in browser-based flows.

<Note>
Secret keys are visible only for a short time after creation or regeneration. Save them in a safe place.  
Sandbox project keys are always visible.
</Note>

### Client-side settings

Client-side settings control which actions are allowed from the browser or widgets.

You can enable options such as:
- Client-side voucher redemption
- Client-side voucher publication
- Client-side voucher listing
- Client-side customer creation
- Client-side voucher expiration updates
- Client-side loyalty and referral events

<Warning>
A warning zone highlights settings that can affect security or data exposure.

## Brand details

The **Brand details** tab stores information required for marketing emails and legal compliance.

Here you provide:
- Brand name
- Physical mailing address
- Contact details
- Website URL
- Logo
- Links to Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

This information is added automatically to the footer of Voucherify email templates.

## Event schema

The **Event schema** tab lets you define custom events and their attributes.

These events can be sent to Voucherify through the API and used as triggers in referral programs, loyalty flows, and other campaigns.

## Metadata schema

The **Metadata schema** tab lets you define custom attributes for different objects, such as campaigns, customers, orders, or products.

Metadata helps you store extra information and use it later in validation rules, segments, and reports.

## API usage

The **API usage** tab shows how your project uses API calls and messages compared to the limits in your plan.

You can use this view to monitor usage, spot spikes, and avoid reaching limits.

### Charts

The charts provide a visual overview of usage over time:

- **API calls per hour**: Shows how many standard API calls are made each hour.
- **API calls per subscription cycle**: Shows total API usage within the current billing period.
- **Bulk API calls per hour**: Shows usage of bulk endpoints over time.
- **Integration webhook calls per day**: Shows how many webhook calls are triggered by integrations.
- **Messages per day**: Shows how many messages are sent each day.
- **Messages per month**: Shows total message usage within the current month.

Each chart also shows how much of the allowed limit is used.

### Notifications

You can set notifications to receive alerts when usage reaches a selected percentage of the limit.  
Notifications can be sent as in-app alerts or emails.

## Error messages

The **Error messages** tab allows you to manage custom error messages and translations.

You can group messages, add translations, and keep error responses consistent across different languages and use cases.

## Areas and stores (Enterprise)

The **Areas and stores** tab allows you to organize campaigns by region or point of sale.

You can:
- Create areas that represent regions or markets
- Assign stores to areas
- Control access for users working in specific locations

This helps teams work independently without affecting campaigns in other areas.

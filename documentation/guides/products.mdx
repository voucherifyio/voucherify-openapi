In the **Products** section of your dashboard, you can build and manage your product inventory. By defining standard and custom product attributes, you can create specific rules for promotions and loyalty programs.

## Key terms

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

* **Product ID**: A unique internal identifier (e.g., `prod_09268673c85013482b`) assigned automatically by Voucherify.
* **Source ID**: An optional external ID that matches the identifier in your own system.
* **SKU**: A product variant. SKUs inherit product-level metadata but can also have their own unique attributes.
* **Order**: The data entity used to pass transactional information. Providing order items is required to execute product-specific validation rules.

## Create products

You can add products manually through the dashboard or programmatically via the API. Adding products to Voucherify is not strictly required to create dynamic rules, but it helps organize your campaigns.

### Create a product in the Dashboard

Creating a new product is a sequential process involving details, variants, and metadata.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize">

    * **Image**: Upload a product image (optional).
    Click **Next step**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add SKUs (optional)">
    Click **Create SKU** to add variants. For each variant, you can define a unique Name, Source ID, Price, and specific attribute values. Click **Save** and then **Next step**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add metadata (optional)">
    Configure values for custom attributes defined in your **Metadata Schema**. Click **Next step**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and save">
    Check the information in the **Summary** and click **Save** to add the product to your catalog.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create a product via API

Use the [Create Product API](/api-reference/products/create-product) to programmatically manage your items and SKUs.

## Bulk import with CSV

You can use CSV files to import new products and SKUs or update existing product names.

<Info>
  **File Requirements:**
  - Maximum file size: 10 MB.
  - Dates must follow **ISO 8601** (e.g., `2024-03-11`).
  - Metadata headers must not contain spaces.
</Info>

### Import steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the file">
    Download the [CSV Import Template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/5902f1c12c7d3a057f88a36d/attachments/627b82ed68d51e779443f550/Import_products_template.csv) and fill it with your product data. 
    <Tip>To import SKUs, ensure you include the `Product id` (Source ID of the parent) to link them correctly.</Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload">
    Go to **Products** and click the **Import CSV** tool in the top right. Select **Import products** and upload your file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map fields">
    Map your CSV columns to Voucherify fields. Click the **plus (+)** button to confirm each mapping.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute import">
    Click **Import**. Voucherify will process the file and notify you in the **Notification Center** once finished.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Export data

You can export your complete product list or a filtered subset for reporting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open export manager">
    In the **Products** tab, click the three-dot menu in the upper right and select **Export**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select attributes">
    Choose which standard attributes and custom metadata to include in the CSV.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Click **Export**. The file will be generated and delivered to your **Notifications Center**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you have added products to your inventory, you can manage them directly from the **Products** section. This section covers how to access product details and perform administrative actions like editing or deleting entries.

## Administrative actions

In the main **Products** list, each item includes a three-dot menu (actions menu) on the right side. Clicking this menu reveals three primary options:

* **Details**: Opens the comprehensive product view, including its SKUs and metadata.
* **Edit**: Allows you to modify standard attributes such as the name, price, or image.
* **Delete**: Removes the product from your active catalog. You can choose to move it to the bin or delete it permanently.

<Warning>
  Deleting a product permanently also removes all associated SKUs and may impact active validation rules that rely on that product ID.
</Warning>

## View product details

Clicking **Details** (or the product name) opens a tabbed interface that centralizes all information related to a specific item. The details view is organized into the following tabs:

### Dashboard

The **Dashboard** tab provides a high-level overview of the product's core attributes:

* **Name**: The internal display name of the product.
* **Source ID**: The unique identifier from your external system.
* **Price**: The base currency value assigned to the product.
* **Attributes**: A list of defined characteristics used in SKU creation.

### SKU

The **SKU** tab lists all variants associated with the parent product. From here, you can manage individual SKU prices and specific attribute values such as size or color.

### Metadata

The **Metadata** tab displays custom attributes assigned to the product. These are key-value pairs that extend the product's characteristics for advanced filtering and validation rules.

### Activity

The **Activity** tab provides a complete audit log of all actions performed on the product or its SKUs.

Categories help you organize campaigns in the **Stacking rules** view.

You can create categories, assign campaigns to them, and configure how campaigns behave when stacking applies.

## Create a category

You can create a category from the **Stacking rules** view by clicking **Create category**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter category name">
    In **Name category**, enter a name for the category.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set hierarchy">
    In **Hierarchy**, enter a number.

    The hierarchy number helps define category priority when campaigns are applied together. A lower number means higher priority. For example, a category with hierarchy **1** is treated as more important than a category with hierarchy **2**.

    The hierarchy number is displayed next to the category name in the **Stacking rules** view.
  </Step>

<Step title="Configure stacking eligibility">
  **Stacking eligibility** defines how campaigns assigned to this category behave when they are validated together in the same redemption.

  This setting controls how campaigns from this category interact with campaigns from other categories.

  Choose one option:

  - **Common**: Campaigns follow the application order.

    They:
    - Stack with other Common campaigns.
    - Stack with Always stackable campaigns.
    - Do not stack with Never stackable campaigns.

  - **Never stackable**: Campaigns in this category block Common campaigns in the same redemption stack.

    They:
    - Do not stack with Common campaigns.
    - Stack with Always stackable campaigns.
    - Stack with other Never stackable campaigns.

    This option is typically used for exclusive campaigns.

<Note>
    Never stackable campaigns can be applied together only if the global limits in stacking settings allow it.
</Note>

  - **Always stackable**: Campaigns in this category always join the redemption stack if they are valid.

    They:
    - Stack with Common campaigns.
    - Stack with Never stackable campaigns.
    - Stack with other Always stackable campaigns.

</Step>

  <Step title="Configure no effect behavior">
    In **No effect**, choose how the system handles a campaign that has no calculated effect:

    - **Default**: Uses the global No effect setting.

    - **Prevent redemption**: The campaign is redeemed only if an effect was calculated.

    - **Force redemption**: The campaign is redeemed even if it has no effect.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure discount calculations">
    In **Discount calculations**, choose how discounts are calculated:

    - **Default**: Uses the global discount calculation setting.

    - **Initial**: Calculates the discount from the original order value.

    - **Discounted**: Calculates the discount from the current order value after previous discounts are applied.
  </Step>

<Step title="Set stacking limit">
  In **Stacking limit**, enter the maximum number of campaigns from this category that can be applied in one redemption.

  The maximum value depends on the global setting:
  **Maximum number of valid incentives to apply in a request** defined in **Stacking settings**.

  For example:
  - If the global limit is set to 10, you can set up to 10 here.
  - You can also set any lower number, such as 3 or 5.

  <Info>
  The maximum number for stacking limit is 30.
  </Info>
  
</Step>

  <Step title="Summary">
    Check if the data is correct and **Save** to add the new category.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assign campaigns to a category

Campaigns are shown in columns, including **No category** and category columns.

To assign a campaign:

1. Locate the campaign in the list.
2. Drag it into another category column.
3. Drop it to confirm the assignment.

The campaign is now assigned to the selected category.

## Edit or delete a category

Each category has a three-dot menu next to its name.

Use this menu to manage the category:

- **Edit**: Update the category settings.

- **Delete**: Remove the category.

## Compatibility matrix

The **Compatibility matrix** helps you review how categories interact.

To open it, click **Compatibility matrix** in the Stacking rules view.

The matrix lists category pairs and shows whether they can stack together.

Use this view when you want to confirm how categories combine before assigning campaigns.

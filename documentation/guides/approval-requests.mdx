<Info>
  **Enterprise feature**: Approval requests are available on Enterprise plans upon request. Contact your Voucherify account manager to enable this feature.
</Info>

Approval requests help you protect campaigns from internal errors or fraud. When approval policies are enabled, selected changes must be reviewed and approved before they are applied in the system.

## How approval requests work

Approval workflows are enabled through **custom user roles with limitations**. When a user with such a role performs a restricted action, Voucherify creates an approval request instead of applying the change immediately.

### Supported actions

You can require approval for the following actions:

- **Campaigns**
  - creating campaigns
  - updating campaigns
- **Vouchers**
  - adding vouchers to existing campaigns
  - updating vouchers
  - creating standalone (generic) vouchers
- **Validation rules**
  - creating or updating validation rules

Changes are applied only after the request is approved.

### Approval logic

- You can assign up to **5 approvers** to a single request.
- Approval is granted as soon as **one approver** approves the request.
- Until approval, changes remain **inactive** in the system.

## Campaign approval modes

Approval behavior depends on the limitations set in the custom role:

- **Created campaigns must be approved**  
  Users can create campaigns, but the campaign is disabled and requires approval before activation.

- **Created campaigns and updates must be approved**  
  Campaign creation and all later changes require approval before they are applied.

These settings define whether approval is a simple or a more complex workflow.

## Approval request statuses

Each request has a clear status that shows its current state:

- **Pending** – waiting for an approver’s action  
- **Approved** – approved and applied in the system  
- **Changes requested** – the approver asked for updates before approval  
- **Rejected** – the request was declined and will not be applied  
- **Draft** – the request was started but not submitted  

You can always check the status in the **Approval requests** view.

## Where to find approval requests

To open approval requests in the dashboard:

**Left sidebar** → click your **user name** → **Approval requests**

Both requesters and approvers use this view to manage requests.

## How to create an approval request

If your role requires approval, Voucherify automatically opens the approval flow when you try to save a restricted change.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a restricted action">
    Begin an action that requires approval, such as creating a campaign or editing a validation rule.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add approvers">
    Click <strong>Add approvers</strong> and select one or more users who can approve changes (for example, Admin users).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a comment">
    Use the <strong>Comment</strong> field to explain the purpose of the change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit the request">
    Click <strong>Save</strong>. The request is sent for approval and marked as <em>Pending</em>.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing and editing requests

After submission, you are redirected to **Approval requests**.

For each request, you can:

- **Details** – view request information
- **Delete** – remove the request
- **View wizard** – return to the editor for complex requests and make changes

If an approver requests changes, you receive an email notification. You can edit the request and submit it again.

## How to approve or reject a request

Approvers see pending requests in **Approval requests**.


 ### Simple operations
 For quick changes:
 1. Select **Details** to see the request.
 2. Add a comment.
 3. Click **Approve** or **Reject**.

 ### Complex operations
 For larger changes:
 1. Click **View Wizard** to review all settings the requester has chosen.
 2. For some requests, you may also see an **Open dialog** button.  
    This opens the original action dialog in read-only mode, so you can review all configuration details before making a decision.
 3. After reviewing the steps, add a comment.
 4. Choose one of the following:
     - **Approve**: Applies the changes to the system immediately.
     - **Request changes**: Sends the request back to the user for edits.
     - **Reject**: Cancels the request entirely.

## Notifications

You can control how you receive updates about approval requests.

To configure notifications:

1. Open **Notification center**
2. Go to **Personal settings**
3. Find **Approval requests changed**
4. Enable or disable **In-app** or **Email** notifications

<Tip>
Approvers receive notifications for new requests. Requesters receive notifications when the status of their request changes.

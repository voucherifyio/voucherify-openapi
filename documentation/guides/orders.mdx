Orders represent customer purchases within Voucherify. If you connect your system to the [**Orders API**](/api-reference/orders/order-calculated-object), you will see new records every time your customers create a new order. The Orders tab helps you track your customers' orders and all transactional activities. 

You can manage orders by using the Dashboard or via the API.

## Orders view

The **Orders** section displays a list of all transactional records. Use this view to monitor sales activity and manage existing data.

### Record details

Each line in the order list contains:

* **Status**: The current state of the order.
* **ID**: A unique identifier (click this to open the **Order detailed view**).
* **Customer**: The customer who placed the order.
* **Items**: The number of items in the cart.
* **Amount**: Total value before discounts.
* **Discounted amount**: The total value reduced by applied incentives.
* **Created**: The timestamp when the order was logged.

## Order detailed view

Clicking an **Order ID** provides a deep dive into the transaction data, including the cart structure (products and SKUs), total amounts, and metadata.

### Order statuses

* **Order created**: The order has been logged.
* **Order paid**: The order was redeemed and finalized.
* **Order cancelled**: The order was cancelled. Using **redemption rollback** automatically switches a status from *paid* to *cancelled*.
* **Order fulfilled**: A flexible status indicating the order was created but not yet paid.

### Advanced tracking

* **Metadata**: Store custom attributes (like "shipping_method") to build specific validation rules.
* **Activity**: View a real-time history of all status changes and updates to the order.

## Add an order

Voucherify allows you to add order records manually for individual entries or automatically for high-volume transactional data.

### Manual creation via Dashboard

Use the Dashboard to manually add an order record for testing or offline sales.

  <Step title="Open the creation wizard">

    Click the **+ Create Order** button in the top right corner.

  <Step title="Define basic details">

    In the **Details** section, provide the following:

    * **Source ID**: Your internal reference identifier for the order.
    * **Status**: Select the current state (e.g., `CREATED`, `PAID`, `CANCELLED`, or `FULFILLED`).

    Click **Next step** to continue.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add line items">

    In the **Items** section, click **Add Item** to specify products or SKUs. For each item, you can set the **Price** and **Quantity**. Click **Calculate** to update the **Total order amount**.

  <Step title="Assign a customer">

    In the **Customer (optional)** section, link the order to an existing customer profile or create a new one.

  <Step title="Specify a referrer">

    In the **Referrer (optional)** section, assign a referrer if the order was driven by a referral campaign. You can also create a new referrer.

  </Step>

<Step title="Configure metadata">

  In the **Metadata (optional)** section, you can add custom attributes to the order object to enhance tracking and build complex validation rules.
    
  Ensure the metadata structure matches the schema defined in your **Project settings**.
  
    * **Add properties**: Use **Add to schema** to include predefined attributes or **Add unknown property** for custom keys.
  
    * **Assign values**: Define the **Key**, **Type**, and **Value** for each metadata entry.
  
    * **Reload schema**: Click **Reload schema** to refresh the available metadata fields if changes were made in project settings.

  </Step>

</Steps>

### Automatic import via API

For production environments, use the [Create Order API endpoint](/api-reference/orders/create-order) to sync your storefront with Voucherify in real-time.

<Tip>

  Syncing orders via API ensures that **Validation rules** based on cart content are triggered instantly during the checkout process.

</Tip>

## Use orders in Voucherify

Grouping and syncing order data allows you to automate rewards and restrict promotions.

### Validation rules

Execute rules that define the required cart structure:

* **Cart volume**: Limit redemptions to specific order amounts (e.g., "Spend at least $50").
* **Cart content**: Restrict discounts to specific products or quantities.

### Customer segments

Divide customers into segments based on their purchase history:

* **High-spenders**: Customers with a total amount spent over a specific threshold.
* **Loyal buyers**: Customers who have reached a specific number of orders.

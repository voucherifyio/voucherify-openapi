Orders represent customer purchases. If you connect your system to the [**Orders API**](/api-reference/orders/order-calculated-object), you will see new entries every time your customers create a new order. The **Orders** tab helps you track your customers' orders and all transactional activities. 

You can manage orders by using the Dashboard or the Orders API.

## Orders view

The **Orders** section displays a list of all transactional records. Use this view to monitor sales activity and manage existing data.

Each line in the order list contains:
* **Status**: The current state of the order:
  * **Order created**: The order has been logged.
  * **Order paid**: The order was finalized.
  * **Order cancelled**: The order was cancelled. Using **redemption rollback** automatically switches a status from *paid* to *cancelled*.
  * **Order fulfilled**: A flexible status indicating the order was created but not yet paid.
* **ID**: A unique identifier (click this to open the **Order detailed view**).
* **Customer**: The customer who placed the order.
* **Items**: The number of items in the cart.
* **Amount**: Total value before discounts.
* **Discounted amount**: The total value reduced by applied incentives.
* **Created**: The timestamp when the order was logged.

Click an order ID to open its details and see its **Dashboard** with transaction data and cart structure, **Metadata**, and **Activity**. You can change the its status or edit the order.

## Add an order

You can add order records manually for individual entries or automatically for high-volume transactional data.

### Add manually in Dashboard

    Optionally, add **Total order amount** only, without specific cart items.

    This order will then appear in the customer's profile.

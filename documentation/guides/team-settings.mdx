Team settings control your whole Voucherify account. Only the **account owner** can open and manage Team settings.

To open Team settings, use your profile menu in the bottom-left corner of the dashboard and choose **Team settings**.

## Subscription

The Subscription section shows your plan, billing details, and usage.

You can:
- create a subscription by choosing **Create subscription**, selecting a plan, confirming billing details, and adding a payment card
- update your payment method
- edit billing details using the edit option in the Billing details section
- review API usage and limits

### API usage overview

Team settings show API usage across projects. You can open the project selector (the down arrow) to choose a project and view its usage.

You can also set notifications for API usage. Under the charts, use **Set notifications** to choose:
- the usage threshold (a percent of your limit)
- how often Voucherify sends alerts
- who receives the alerts

For project-only usage details, you can also review **Project settings > API usage** inside a specific project.

## Invoices

Voucherify issues invoices monthly. You can find them in the Invoices tab and download them for your records.

## Team

The Team section is where you manage account users.

You can:
- use filters to find team members
- invite a new user with **Invite member**
- edit or remove a user using the three-dots (actions) menu

When you invite a user, you can also choose which projects they can access and what role they have in each project.

## Roles

Roles control what users can see and do in the dashboard and API.

### Owner flag

Owner is not a role. It is a flag on a user account. The owner flag gives access to Team settings. It does not change what the user can do inside projects.

An owner can still have any role, even a role with limited access (for example, Viewer).

### Built-in roles

When you assign a role to a user in a project, you can choose from built-in roles:
- **Admin**: full access to the account and projects
- **User**: can read and change data in assigned projects, but cannot manage team settings
- **Viewer**: can read and export data, but cannot change it
- **Merchant**: limited access for code operations (for example, validate and redeem single incentives)
- **Restricted user**: can work only in assigned areas or stores (this depends on areas and stores)

### Custom roles (enterprise)

On enterprise plans, you can create custom roles. Custom roles are defined for the whole account, and then assigned to users per project.

To manage roles, go to **Team settings > Roles**. From there you can:
- review what each role allows
- add new roles by duplicating an existing role
- edit custom roles

## Security

The Security section lets you enforce account-level security rules.

You can enforce two-factor authentication for your team. Voucherify supports:
- SMS codes
- Google Authenticator
- backup codes

## Projects

The Projects section shows all projects in your account.

You can:
- filter projects
- create a new project with **Create project**
- switch to a project to see its details
- delete a project using the actions menu

### Create a project

When you create a project, you set:
- name
- description (optional)
- region (Europe, United States, or Asia (Singapore))
- time zone
- currency
- default international dialing prefix (optional)

You also set voucher code case sensitivity as a permanent project setting:
- case sensitive: `cOdE1` and `CODE1` are different codes
- case insensitive: `cOdE1` and `CODE1` are treated as the same code

<Warning>
You cannot change voucher code case sensitivity after you create the project.
</Warning>

You can also add users to the project during creation (optional). For each user, you choose a role for that project.

## Legal & compliance

Voucherify is a GDPR-compliant data processor. In Legal compliance, you can review terms and policies and add contact details, such as:
- EU representative
- data protection officer
- security contact person

You can also view supporting compliance files available in the dashboard.

## Delete people data

Use Delete people data to permanently remove customer history for GDPR requests.

You can search for a customer (active or archived), choose delete, and confirm.

## Management API (enterprise)

The Management API provides endpoints for administrative operations such as managing projects, users, schemas, webhooks, and branding.

You can review Management API usage in the Subscription section of Team settings.

## Choose the right API endpoint

Voucherify hosts API clusters in multiple regions. Pick the one closest to your users for lower latency.

**Shared cluster endpoints**

- Europe (default): https://api.voucherify.io

- United States: https://us1.api.voucherify.io

- Asia (Singapore): https://as1.api.voucherify.io

If your company uses a **dedicated cluster**, use its unique URL. Calling the wrong region returns an error.

<Note>
SDKs let you override the default API endpoint if your project is hosted elsewhere.

## Understand request processing

Each API request runs in two phases:

- **Synchronous phase** — main response (for example, redemption result).

- **Asynchronous phase** — [background tasks](https://support.voucherify.io/article/524-project-logs#background-tasks-overview) such as:

  - Updating segments

  - Sending webhooks
  
  - Applying loyalty points
  
  - Triggering distributions

Async operations may complete a few seconds later. Monitor them under **Dashboard → Background Tasks**.

**Examples of long-running jobs**

- Bulk imports or exports (customers, products, vouchers)

- Campaign creation or updates

- Metadata updates

## Improve performance and efficiency

Voucherify optimizes most requests for speed. Average response time on shared clusters:

- **Validations:** ~100–200 ms  

- **Redemptions:** ~150–350 ms  

Longer operations (for example, campaign creation) can take more time.

Follow these rules to keep your integration fast and efficient.

### Use efficient API flows

Follow the recommended flows for validation, redemption, and campaign management. Avoid unnecessary round-trips.

### Don’t pre-synchronize data

You can send customer, order, or product data directly in validation or redemption calls. No need to pre-create them.

### Replace polling with webhooks

Use webhooks instead of repeated API requests. Webhooks don’t count toward API call limits and deliver updates in real time.

## Client-side API (browser and mobile)

Use the client-side API only when you must expose live validation in a web or mobile app. Example: check a promo code on checkout.

### SDK and widgets

The **Voucherify JS SDK** includes methods and components for:

- Validation  

- Redemption  

- Voucher publication  

- Subscription forms  

React components are also available.

### Rate limiting

Client-side calls share a global limit per IP address. If the limit is exceeded, the API returns:

```json
{
  "code": 429,
  "message": "Too many requests hit the API too quickly."
}
```

### Client-side settings

Go to **Dashboard** → **Project Settings** → **Client-side Settings** to configure:

- **Allowed website URLs** — list allowed origins.
Use * only in development.

- **Danger Zone options** — enable with caution:

    - Redeeming vouchers

    - Publishing vouchers

    - Listing vouchers

    - Creating customers

    - Updating voucher expiration

    - Creating loyalty or referral events

<Warning> Enable these only if you fully understand the security impact. </Warning>

## Manage API versions

Voucherify releases dated API versions (for example, 2022-09-01). Your project won’t auto-upgrade. You control when to move.

Check your current version in **Project Setting** → **API Version**.

### Upgrading

1. Review the API changelog

2. Test the new version in a sandbox project.

3. Click Upgrade to the latest API version when ready.

### Backward-compatible changes

Voucherify may:

- Add new endpoints or properties

- Add optional parameters

- Change property order

- Introduce new webhook event types

Your integration should ignore unknown fields and event types.

## Management API (Enterprise)

Enterprise accounts may use the Management API to automate project and user administration.
It covers actions such as creating projects, managing users, and editing schemas.

Customer segments group your audience based on shared attributes, behavior, or custom metadata. These groups are used to build validation rules, loyalty earning rules and trigger incentive distribution.

To manage segments, navigate to **Engagement** > **Segments** in your dashboard.

## Segment types

Voucherify uses three distinct segment types.

### Static segment

A fixed list of up to **20,000 customers** that does not update automatically.

- **Best for**: One-time marketing lists or manually curated groups.
- **Constraint**: Membership never changes after creation.

### Passive segment

A filter-based group that updates in real time and is not used in campagins.

- **Definition**: Membership updates automatically as criteria are met, but the segment does **not** trigger any “entered” or “left” events.
- **Best for**: **Validation rules**, where the system only needs to check if a customer is currently eligible.
- **Scale**: No fixed member limit (filter-based).

<Note>
By default, a newly created filter-based segment is **passive**.  
</Note>

<Warning>
### Automatic activation

If a passive segment is used in:
- **loyalty earning rules**
- **distributions**
- **referral tiers**

Voucherify automatically converts it into an **active segment**.

Once activated:
- The segment begins triggering join and leave events.
- The segment becomes **read-only** and can no longer be edited.
</Warning>

### Active segment

A filter-based group designed for **real-time automation and lifecycle tracking**.

- **Definition**: Membership updates automatically and **triggers events** when customers enter or leave the segment.
- **Events**: Triggers `customer.entered.segment` and `customer.left.segment`.
- **Best for**: Automated **distributions**, loyalty **earning rules**, and **referral tiers**.

## Editing segments

- **Static segments cannot be edited** after creation.

- **Passive segments** can be edited after creation.
  - You can add, remove, or modify filters.
  - You can rename the segment.
  - Each passive segment must contain **at least one filter**.
  - Edits can be made from the **segment list** or the **segment details view** using the three-dots menu.

- **Active segments cannot be edited** after creation.
  - This restriction ensures consistency for event-driven workflows.

## Create a static segment

Use this segment type to manually group specific customers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Segments">
    Go to **Engagement** > **Segments** and click **Create segment**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select customers">
    Mark the customer's checkboxes. You can search for specific customers or use filters to to narrow down the results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Select the desired customers and click **Save as segment** > **Static segment**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a passive or active segment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Segments">
    Go to **Engagement** > **Segments** and click **Create segment**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define filters">
    Add one or more filters using profile attributes, events, or metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save the segment. It will be created as a **passive segment**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filter categories

You can build segments using multiple attributes:

- **Profile attributes**: Standard fields such as **email**, **city**, or **source**.
- **Activity & events**: Behavioral data like total order count, last purchase date, or custom API events.
- **Customer metadata**: Custom attributes defined in your **customer metadata schema**.

<Tip>
  **Bulk input**: When using the **"in"** condition, click **Bulk input** to paste up to 200 values at once, separated by commas, semicolons, or new lines.
</Tip>

## Manage and use segments

### Management actions

From the **Segments** tab, you can:

- **Audit**: Review filters, evaluation logic, and the current member count.
- **Export**: Download a CSV file with all segment members.
- **Delete**: Remove segments that are no longer needed.

### Usage in campaigns

- **Validation rules**: Define incentive eligiblity based on segment.
- **Distributions**: Trigger automated workflows that send incentives when customers enter or leave an **active segment**.
- **Earning rules**: Each earning rule defines an action that assigns a particular number of points to a customer's account, in this case, customer entered segment event.

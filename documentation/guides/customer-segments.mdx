Customer segments group your audience based on shared attributes, behavior, or custom metadata, like country, number of finalized orders, or custom attribute `"VIP": true`. These groups are used to build validation rules, loyalty earning rules, and trigger incentive distribution.

To manage segments, navigate to **Engagement** > **Segments** in your dashboard.

## Segment types

Voucherify uses three distinct segment types.

### Static segment

A **Static segment** is a fixed list of up to 20,000 customers that does not update automatically.

Static segments are useful for one-time campaigns or lists you manage manually. After you create them, the list of customers is fixed. 

Static segments cannot be edited after creation, meaning you can't edit the list of customers who are in such segment.

### Dynamic segment – passive

A **Dynamic segment** – **passive** is a filter-based group that updates in real time.

Passive segments update automatically when customers meet or stop meeting the defined filters. Passive segments do not send events when a customer enters or leaves the segment. This makes them useful for validation rules, where the system only needs to check if a customer is eligible at the moment.

**Passive segments** can be edited after creation.

By default, a newly created filter-based segment is **passive**.

### Dynamic segment – active

Voucherify automatically converts a **passive segment** into an **active segment** if it is used in:
- **Loyalty earning rules**
- **Distributions**
- **Referral tiers**

Once activated:
- The segment begins triggering segment entered and segment left events.
- The segment can no longer be edited.

Like passive segments, active segments update automatically when customers meet or stop meeting the rules. When this happens, the system sends events for entering and leaving the segment. This makes active segments useful for automated distributions, loyalty earning rules, and referral tiers, as well as for tracking customer behavior where actions should happen as soon as a customer’s status changes.

## Create segments

Go to **Engagement** > **Segments** to **Create segment**.

### Create static segment

Use this segment type to manually group specific customers.

<Steps>
  
  <Step title="Select customers">
    
    Check the customer's checkboxes. You can search for specific customers or use filters to narrow down the results.

    You can check up to 20,000 customers.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    
    Once ready, **Save as segment** > **Static segment**.

  </Step>

</Steps>

A static customer segment with a unique ID is added to **Segments** list.

### Create dynamic segment – passive

<Steps>
  
  <Step title="Define filters">

    Add one or more filters using profile attributes, events, or metadata.

    You can build segments using multiple attributes:
    - **Profile** attributes: Standard fields such as **email**, **city**, or **source**.
    - **Activity** and **Events**: Behavioral data like total order number, last purchase date, or custom API events.
    - Customer **Metadata**: Custom attributes defined in your customer metadata schema.

    <Tip>

      **Bulk input**: When using the **"in"** condition, click **Bulk input** to paste up to 200 values at once, separated by commas, semicolons, or new lines.

    </Tip>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
  
    Once ready, **Save as segment** > **Dynamic segment**.
  
  </Step>

</Steps>

A passive customer segment with a unique ID is added to **Segments** list.

  <Accordion title="Developer setup: Segments API">
  
    Developers can manage and use segments programmatically with the [Segments API](/api-reference/segments/segment-object). This includes creating segments, updating filters, checking segment membership, and using segments in automated workflows. The API is useful when segment logic or usage is managed outside the Dashboard or needs to stay in sync with external systems.

Customer segments group your audience based on shared attributes, behavior, or custom metadata. These groups are used to personalize communication and enforce redemption rules across campaigns.

To manage segments, navigate to **Engagement** > **Segments** in your dashboard.

## Segment types

Voucherify uses three distinct segment types to balance system performance with automation and real-time workflows.

### Quick guide

- Use **static segments** when you need a fixed list of customers that will not change.
- Use **passive segments** when you only need to **check eligibility at runtime**.
- Use **active segments** when you want to **react automatically** to customers entering or leaving a group.

### Static segment

A fixed list of up to **20,000 customers** that does not update automatically.

- **Best for**: One-time marketing lists or manually curated groups.
- **Constraint**: Membership never changes based on customer behavior after creation.

### Passive segment

A filter-based group that updates in real time but is optimized for **performance over automation**.

- **Definition**: Membership updates automatically as criteria are met, but the segment does **not** trigger any “entered” or “left” events.
- **Best for**: **Validation rules**, where the system only needs to check if a customer is currently eligible.
- **Scale**: No fixed member limit (filter-based).

### Active segment

A filter-based group designed for **real-time automation and lifecycle tracking**.

- **Definition**: Membership updates automatically and **triggers events** when customers enter or leave the segment.
- **Events**: Triggers `customer.entered.segment` and `customer.left.segment`.
- **Best for**: Automated **distributions**, loyalty **earning rules**, and **referral tiers**.

> **Automatic upgrade**  
> Voucherify automatically upgrades a passive segment to an **active segment** if it is connected to a feature that requires event triggers, such as a distribution or loyalty earning rule.

## Segment behavior and lifecycle

### Default behavior

By default, a newly created filter-based segment is **passive**.  

### Editing segments

- **Passive segments** can be edited after creation.
  - You can add, remove, or modify filters.
  - You can rename the segment.
  - Each passive segment must contain **at least one filter**.
  - Edits can be made from the **segment list** or the **segment details view** using the three-dots menu.

- **Active segments** **cannot be edited** after creation.
  - This restriction ensures consistency for event-driven workflows.

### Automatic activation

If a passive segment is used in:
- loyalty **earning rules**
- **distributions**
- **referral tiers**

Voucherify automatically converts it into an **active segment**.

Once activated:
- The segment begins triggering join and leave events.
- The segment becomes **read-only** and can no longer be edited.

## Create a static segment

Use this method to manually group specific customers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Segments">
    Go to **Engagement** > **Segments** and click **Create segment**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select customers">
    Mark the customer's checkboxes. You can search for specific customers or use filters to to narrow down the results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Select the desired customers and click **Save as segment** > **Static segment**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create a filter-based segment

Filter-based segments are created in the Dashboard and are **passive by default**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Segments">
    Go to **Engagement** > **Segments** and click **Create segment**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define filters">
    Add one or more filters using profile attributes, events, or metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save the segment. It will be created as a **passive segment**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Filter categories

You can build segments using multiple data sources:

- **Profile attributes**: Standard fields such as **email**, **city**, or **source**.
- **Activity & events**: Behavioral data like total order count, last purchase date, or custom API events.
- **Metadata**: Custom attributes defined in your **metadata schema**.

<Tip>
  **Bulk input**: When using the **"in"** condition, click **Bulk input** to paste up to 200 values at once, separated by commas, semicolons, or new lines.
</Tip>

## Manage and use segments

### Management actions

From the **Segments** tab, you can:

- **Audit**: Review filters, evaluation logic, and the current member count.
- **Export**: Download a CSV file with all segment members.
- **Delete**: Remove segments that are no longer needed.

### Usage in campaigns

- **Validation rules**: Restrict redemptions to customers who currently belong to a segment.
- **Distributions**: Trigger automated workflows that send codes when customers enter or leave an **active segment**.

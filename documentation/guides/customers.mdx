Voucherify centralizes customer data to help you run targeted promotions, apply validation rules, and track engagement. You can manage your audience by creating individual profiles, synchronizing data from external systems, or performing bulk imports.

To manage customers, navigate to **Engagement** > **Customers** in your dashboard.

## Customer data model

Each customer profile in Voucherify consists of:

- **Standard attributes** such as name, email, phone number, and address.
- **System-generated data** including orders, redemptions, loyalty points, and referrals.
- **Metadata**, which stores custom attributes used for segmentation, validation rules, personalization, and geofencing.

Understanding this structure is key to modeling customer data correctly and avoiding unintended overwrites.

## Customer identification

Every customer is identified by two unique identifiers:

- **Customer ID**  
  A unique internal identifier assigned automatically by Voucherify.

- **Source ID**  
  A custom identifier from your own system, such as a CRM ID, email address, or phone number.

<Tip>
Use the **Source ID** to keep your external database in sync with Voucherify. When a customer is created or imported with an existing Source ID, Voucherify overwrites the existing profile with the new data.
</Tip>

## Create a customer profile

Customer profiles are created automatically when data is synchronized via API or integrations. You can also add customers manually in the dashboard.

### Manual creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Customers">
    Go to **Engagement** > **Customers**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the add form">
    Click the three-dots menu in the upper-right corner and select **Add customer**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter customer details">
    Provide the following information:
    - **General information**: Name, Source ID, description, birthdate.
    - **Contact details**: Email address and phone number.
    - **Address**: Physical location details.
    - **Metadata**: Custom attributes defined in your Metadata Schema.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to create the profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data import and synchronization

Voucherify offers multiple ways to keep customer data up to date across systems.

### CSV import

CSV imports allow you to create new customer profiles or update existing ones in bulk.

<Note>
**Import guidelines**
- **Maximum file size**: 10 MB.
- **Date format**: ISO 8601 (for example, `2022-03-11` or `2022-03-11T09:00:00.000Z`).
- **Headers**: Metadata headers must not contain spaces.
- **Boolean metadata**: Use `true`, `false`, or `null`.
</Note>

<Warning>
When importing customers using **Source ID**, existing profiles with the same Source ID are fully overwritten. This includes standard attributes and metadata.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the file">
    Download the CSV import template and populate it with customer data using supported field names.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the file">
    In the **Customers** view, click **Import** and upload your CSV file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map attributes">
    Map CSV columns to Voucherify fields. Columns not mapped to standard fields can be imported as metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import">
    Confirm the mapping and click **Import**. You will receive a notification once processing is complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Metadata in imports

- Metadata defined in the **Metadata Schema** preserves its data type (number, date, boolean, array).
- Metadata imported without a schema definition is stored as **unknown metadata** and treated as a string.
- Unknown metadata cannot be used for numeric or date-based filtering until it is added to the schema.
- Only non-nested metadata fields are imported correctly.

### API and CRM synchronization

To keep customer data synchronized automatically, invoke the **[Create Customer API](/api-reference/customers/create-customer)** whenever a new user is added to your system.

Voucherify also supports built-in integrations. Visit the **Integrate** articles section in **Developer guides** to check the supported integrations.

## Update and delete customers

### Edit individual profiles

1. Go to **Customers** and click a customer name to open the profile.
2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon.
3. Update standard attributes or metadata.
4. Click **Save** to apply changes.

### Bulk updates

You can update customers in bulk using:

- The **Update Customers in bulk API** endpoint.
- A CSV import file that includes the **Customer ID** or **Source ID** and the fields to update.

### Delete customers

You can delete customers using the actions menu in the dashboard or via a dedicated API endpoint.

<Warning>
Deleting a customer permanently removes their profile and may impact reporting, redemptions, and loyalty history.
</Warning>

## Filter customers

You can filter the customer list to narrow down results based on:

- Profile attributes
- Customer activity and events
- Metadata values

After applying filters:

- The customer list updates dynamically.
- You can save the filtered list as a **static** or **active segment** using **Save as segment**.

## Export customer data

Export customer data to analyze it in external analytics, BI, or CRM tools.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open export tool">
    In the **Customers** section, click **Export**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select attributes">
    Choose which fields to include, such as Source ID, total order amount, loyalty points, or metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Confirm to generate the file. The export will appear in the **Notification Center**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Location-based targeting (geofencing)

You can restrict campaigns to specific geographic areas by passing customer location data as metadata. Voucherify evaluates location-based rules during validation and redemption.

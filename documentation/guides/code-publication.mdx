**Publication** is the process of assigning a unique code (coupon, gift card, referral code, or loyalty card) to a specific customer. Once a code is published, it becomes linked to that customer’s profile in Voucherify.

## Core functions of publication

Publications are required for some campaign types and optional for others. In all cases, they help you control who can use a code and how it is tracked.

### Required publications

- **Referral programs**: A publication is required so the system can identify the code owner and correctly count referred customers.
- **Loyalty programs**: A loyalty card must be published to a customer before they can collect or spend points.

### Optional publications

- **Coupons and gift cards**: Publishing (especially unique or generic coupons) to specific customers is optional, but it helps prevent misuse and limits redemptions to intended users.

## Campaign rules enabled by publication

Publishing codes allows you to use campaign rules that control **who can redeem a code** and **how long it stays valid**:

- **Single code ownership**: You can limit a campaign so each customer can join only once and own only one code from that campaign.
- **Holder-only redemptions**: You can restrict redemptions so only the customer who received the published code can use it.
- **Publication-based timeframes**: You can define how long a code stays valid starting from the moment it is published (for example, the code expires 48 hours after delivery).

## Publication methods

Voucherify offers several ways to publish codes to customers. Regardless of the method, **each unique code can be published to only one customer**.

- **Manual assignment**: You can publish a code from the detailed voucher view in the Dashboard by assigning it to a specific customer.
- **Automatic distributions**: Using the Distribution Manager, you can send and publish codes at the same time through channels like email, SMS, or integrations such as Braze or Intercom.
- **Web widgets**: Codes can be published automatically when a customer completes an action on a landing page or signup form.
- **API integration**: The `Create Publication` API method lets your system publish codes programmatically.

## Publication source ID

The **source ID** is an optional identifier used to track a publication.

When you publish a code using the API and provide a source ID, calling the same publication again with that source ID will always return the **same code** that was assigned the first time. This makes publication requests safe to retry and helps prevent assigning multiple codes by mistake.

From the moment a code is published, it is visible in the customer profile and in campaign-related publication views in the Dashboard.

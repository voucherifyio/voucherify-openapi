We've updated our documentation platform to provide you with a better experience. Here's what's changed:

## Key improvements

### Enhanced navigation

- **Multi-language support** – Switch between different SDK examples seamlessly

### Interactive API playground

The **Try it** feature lets you test API endpoints directly from the documentation:

1. **Select an endpoint** – Navigate to any API reference page
2. **Configure your request** – Fill in parameters and request body
3. **Log in** – Click the "Log in" button to authenticate with your Voucherify credentials
4. **Send requests** – Execute API calls and see real responses from your account

  When you log in to the playground, you're authenticating with your actual Voucherify account. This means you can test with real data and see how the API works with your campaigns, vouchers, and customers.

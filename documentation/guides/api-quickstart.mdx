## Get your API keys

To use the Voucherify API, you need two credentials:
- **Application ID** (sent as `X-App-Id` header)
- **Application secret key** (sent as `X-App-Token` header)

Add these headers to every API request.

**To find your keys:**

1. Go to **Project settings**.
2. Open the **General** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Application keys** section.

**Key types:**

- **Application keys** – Use these to authorize API requests from your server. You can create multiple keys for different users.
- **Client-side keys** – Use these for public applications like mobile apps and websites.
- **Integration keys** – Use these to connect with other platforms.

<Warning>
  **Sandbox API keys are always visible.**

  In production projects:
  - Primary secret key: visible for 14 days after first generation, or 15 minutes after regeneration
  - Secondary secret keys: visible for 15 minutes after generation or regeneration

  Save your secret keys immediately and store them securely.
</Warning>

## Make your first API call

Your Sandbox project includes test campaigns and codes you can use right away.

The most common API call is **validation**. This checks if a customer can use a discount code on their order.

**To make your first validation call:**

1. Log in to your Voucherify account (top right corner of this page). This connects your Sandbox API keys to the interactive documentation.

2. Go to [Validate stackable discounts](/api-reference/validations/validate-stackable-discounts).

3. Click **Try it** button.

4. Select your **Cluster** based on your region:
   - `api` – Europe
   - `us1.api` – North America
   - `as1.api` – Asia

5. The cURL field on the right will already have the Sandbox onboarding validation selected.

6. Click **Send** to send the request.

The response appears above the request. You can modify the request using the interactive documentation.

**Alternative:** Use the [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/voucherify) to make API calls.

**Next steps:** Explore the [Sandbox project and Demo shop](#-explore-the-sandbox-project) to test campaigns and view API payloads.

## Use the Postman collection

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a tool for testing APIs. The Voucherify Postman collection includes all API endpoints and integration examples.

**To get started:**

1. Go to the [Voucherify Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/overview).
2. Fork the collection to your Postman workspace. For beginners, fork [Voucherify API – Onboarding](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/iut4une/voucherify-api-onboarding).
3. Add your API credentials in **Environments**.
4. Send your first [validation request](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/request/m646u4g/onboarding-validation-request).

**Available collections:**

- [Core API endpoints](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/z8gcn5w/voucherify-api-core-api-endpoints) – All Voucherify endpoints
- [Integration examples](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/ymwnigh/voucherify-api-integration-examples) – Integration and business scenarios
- [Sandbox onboarding](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/iut4une/voucherify-api-onboarding) – Learning resources for new users

## Invite team members

## Explore the Sandbox project

The [Sandbox project](https://support.voucherify.io/article/538-sandbox) helps you learn the Voucherify API through the dashboard. Use it alongside the interactive API reference or Postman collection.

**To use the Demo shop:**

1. Go to **Marketer hub** in the left sidebar.

Stacking rules define how multiple incentives are processed together in one validation or redemption request.

They help you control:

- What happens when one incentive is invalid
- The order in which incentives are applied
- How percentage discounts are calculated
- How incentives interact on the same product
- What happens during rollback
- What happens when an incentive has no effect
- How many incentives can be applied at once

<Info>
Only users with an admin role can edit stacking rule settings.

## Application and sorting

These settings define how incentives are validated and ordered.

### Redemption stack validation policy

This setting defines what happens if one incentive in a request fails validation.

**All**: If one incentive is invalid, the whole request fails. No incentives are applied.

**Partial**: Invalid incentives are skipped. Valid incentives are applied.

### Incentive application order

This setting defines the order in which incentives are applied.

**Requested order**: Incentives are applied in the same order as they appear in the API request.

**Hierarchy priority**: Incentives are applied based on category hierarchy. A lower hierarchy number means higher priority. If two incentives have the same hierarchy, the request order is used.

### Always stackable and Never stackable category application order

This setting defines how incentives from Always stackable and Never stackable categories are ordered.

**Apply Always stackable categories last**: Never stackable incentives are applied first. Always stackable incentives are applied afterward.

**Apply sorting rule to combined Always stackable and Never stackable categories**: All incentives are grouped together. The selected sorting rule defines their order.

### Discount calculation mode

This setting defines how percentage discounts are calculated when multiple incentives are applied.

**Based on discounted amount**: Each discount is calculated after previous discounts are applied.

**Based on initial amount**: Each discount is calculated from the original price.

## Discount behavior

These settings define how incentives behave on products and during rollback.

### Product stack policy

This setting defines whether multiple incentives can affect the same product.

**Multiple application**: More than one incentive can affect the same product.

**Single application**: Only one incentive can affect the same product.

### Redemption rollback policy

This setting defines what happens when a redemption is rolled back.

**Revert**: Applied discounts are removed. The order status changes to Canceled.

**Keep**: Applied discounts remain. The order status does not change.

### No effect

This setting defines what happens when an incentive produces no effect.

**Force redemption**: The incentive is marked as redeemed even if it produces no effect.

**Prevent redemption**: The incentive is redeemed only when it produces an effect.

## Global limits

These settings define how many incentives can be processed in one request.

### Maximum number of incentives in a request

Defines how many incentives can be sent in one API request. Maximum value: 30.

### Maximum number of valid incentives to apply in a request

Defines how many valid incentives can be applied. Maximum value: 30.

### Maximum number of valid incentives per category to apply in a request

This setting is optional and defines how many incentives from the same category can be applied. Maximum value: 30.

### Maximum number of valid Never stackable incentives to apply in a request

Defines how many Never stackable incentives can be applied at the same time. Maximum value: 5.

### Maximum number of valid Never stackable incentives per category to apply in a request

This setting is optional and defines how many Never stackable incentives from the same category can be applied. Maximum value: 5.

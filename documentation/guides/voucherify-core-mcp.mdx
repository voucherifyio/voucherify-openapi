## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is an open standard that lets AI agents connect to and work with data from different platforms. It has two main parts:

- **MCP client:** The application where the AI agent runs, such as Claude Code, Cursor, Visual Studio Code, Windsurf, or others.
- **MCP package:** A service provided by another platform that defines which tools the AI can use and what data it can access. It is hosted locally by users.

<Note>
Currently, only the local MCP package is supported.

Voucherify developers are planning to work on a remote MCP server. Reach out to [Voucherify support](https://www.voucherify.io/contact-support) or your Technical Account Manager if you're interested in this solution.

## About Voucherify Core MCP

After [setting up the Voucherify Core MCP](#setting-up-voucherify-core-mcp) locally, you can connect AI tools directly to Voucherify. This way, these tools can read data regarding campaigns, promotion tiers, orders, products, vouchers, and more.

The Voucherify Core MCP is great for:

- Building AI tools that need data from Voucherify.
- Your engineers to create complex scenarios and integrate with other MCP integrations.
- Technical marketers who want to use natural language commands to fetch Voucherify data from multiple sources for analytics and other purposes.

The Voucherify Core MCP uses a number of endpoints for reading data. To prevent accidental changes to your campaigns, validation rules, and other data, creating and updating data is currently not supported.

<Note>

### Voucherify Core MCP GitHub repo

To explore Voucherify Core MCP test engine, run it from source, or contribute, visit [Voucherify Core MCP repo](https://github.com/voucherifyio/core-mcp/). The repo also includes Python test scenarios showing MCP capabilities.

- *Get_voucher*: Returns full details of a specific voucher, such as code, status, balance, and expiration date, to support redemption or troubleshooting.

## Best practices

Follow these practices to get the best results.

### Ask specific questions

- Use precise date ranges (for example “July 2025 redemptions”) instead of vague prompts like “recent redemptions”.
- Describe exactly what you need: specific campaign names, product categories, or data types.
- Broad requests (for example “all campaigns in the last 3 years”) usually lead to unclear results.

### Add more context if necessary

If results look off, reframe your query or try again. If the AI loops or repeats itself, redirect with a new question or start a new chat with a more detailed prompt.

### Ask more questions

Once you've got an answer you like, ask the client to:

- Suggest additional insights or next steps.
- Explain how it reached its conclusions to help refine your future prompts.

### Change model

If you're not satisfied with answers or the overall process, use a different AI model. Each model is trained on different data, has their own strengths, and is best suited for various tasks.

### Prompt examples

Read the following prompt examples for inspiration on how to use Voucherify Core MCP:

- Find customer by email `tom@example.com` (or `source_id`, or `customer_id`). Return the ID, `loyalty_balance`, `active_vouchers`.
- Count total of customers in segment “VIP”. List their basic details: name, email address, `source_id`. Turn the data into a CSV-friendly format.
- List active campaigns with fields: ID, name, type, `start_date`, `end_date`.
- Get voucher by code “BK-4829” and show: status, `redemption.count`, `redemption.limit`, `balance` (for gift or loyalty cards).
- Get campaign “BK-Sept-20OFF” data: total budget, spent budget, redemption counts, and per-customer caps.
- Get redemptions aggregated by day between 2025-09-01 and 2025-09-03 (timezone Europe/Warsaw).
- Get best deals for a customer with this email address. They have these items in their cart: Voucherify T-shirt (SKU: VCH-TST-001, quantity: 1, price: 25 USD), Voucherify Mug (SKU: VCH-MUG-002, quantity: 2, price: 15 USD each). Suggest if there's anything they can do to get even better deals.

<Warning>
The number of API calls made by the Voucherify MCP depends on your question. Complex queries, like get best deals for a given customer, will need more API calls, while simple questions can be limited to just a few or even one, like get campaign summary. The MCP client will ask for confirmation to make an API call.

The API calls made with the Voucherify MCP are included in your billing period.
</Warning>

## Use examples

You can interact with the Voucherify MCP using natural language in your AI agents, just as you would with other AI tools.

### Get best deals for a given customer

In this scenario, the user wants to learn what best deals a customer, Alex Doe, can get if they have a specific cart. The scenario used is `get_best_deals`.

![](/images/docs/voucherify-core-mcp-01.png "Voucherify Core MCP best deals example - prompt")

The Voucherify Core MCP ran 9 API calls to find out what best deals Alex Doe can get at the moment and what they'll get if they meet specific conditions.

![](/images/docs/voucherify-core-mcp-02.png "Voucherify Core MCP best deals example - response")

In this case, one prompt was enough to propose best deals for Alex Doe, like:

- Adding one product to meet a bundle promotion,
- Take part in Friday happy hours promotion,
- Becoming a VIP customer,
- Using a gift card.

### Get details about campaigns

In this scenario, the user wants to learn what Voucherify campaigns there are in the project and if they're active, have time frames set, and similar details. . This gives a quick overview of needed info about campaigns.

![](/images/docs/voucherify-core-mcp-03.png "Voucherify Core MCP get campaign details example - prompt")

The Voucherify Core MCP runs 8 API calls to fetch the requested data.

![](/images/docs/voucherify-core-mcp-04.png "Voucherify Core MCP get campaign details example - response")

The MCP returned campaign details and summarized the campaigns by their type, status, and provided time frames. For example, the response shows:

- The Loyalty program campaign is still inactive as it is a draft;
- The Friday Happy Hours campaign is valid on Fridays, between 15:00 and 17:00;
- BLACKFRIDAY2025 is active, but the time frame is set to between 28 and 30 November 2025.

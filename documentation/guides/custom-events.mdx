Custom events represent actions taken by your customers, such as abandoning a cart, submitting a review, or completing a tutorial. By tracking these behaviors, you can create **dynamic, behavior-driven campaigns** that react to real-time activity instead of relying on static customer attributes.

Custom events allow you to:
- personalize incentives based on customer behavior
- trigger automated distributions
- limit redemptions using event-based rules
- award loyalty points when specific actions occur

## Workflow overview

Implementing custom events consists of four main steps:

1. **Enable tracking**  
   Your application calls the Voucherify API whenever a defined customer action occurs.

2. **Define schema**  
   You register the event and its metadata attributes in the dashboard.

3. **Pass data**  
   Your system sends event data to Voucherify via the API.

4. **Automate**  
   Logged events can be used for segmentation, validation rules, distributions, and loyalty earning rules.

<Note>
Custom events require development work. Events must be sent to Voucherify explicitly using the API.
</Note>

## Defining a new custom event

Before Voucherify can process custom events, you must define their structure in the **event schema**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to event schema">
    Go to **project settings** &gt; **event schema** and click **add event definition**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define event attributes">
    Enter the event name and define optional or required metadata attributes. Metadata properties are key-value pairs (for example, `category: "electronics"`) that extend the event structure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to the API">
    Once the event is defined, developers can use the **create custom event API** endpoint to log customer actions. Each logged event is automatically linked to a specific customer profile.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Segmenting customers by behavior

You can group customers based on the **frequency** and **recency** of custom events to create auto-updating segments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply event filters">
    In the **customers** section, click **add filter** and choose **events**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set metrics">
    Build criteria using event-based metrics:
    - **has occurred** – total number of times the event was recorded
    - **last occurred** – number of days since the last event
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save segment">
    Define conditions (for example, “more than 2 times”) and save the segment. Customers automatically enter or leave the segment as their behavior changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using custom events in validation rules

Event-based segments and event metadata can be used to **limit redemptions and earning rules**.

### Redemption limits with custom events

You can restrict redemptions based on customer behavior by:

1. Creating an auto-updating segment based on a custom event  
   *(for example, customers who submitted at least two reviews)*

2. Adding a validation rule to a campaign that:
   - allows redemption only for that segment
   - or excludes customers outside the segment

This ensures incentives are redeemable **only when customers meet behavioral criteria**.

### Validation rules based on event metadata

You can also build validation rules directly on **custom event metadata**, for example:
- allow redemption only if `review_type = "video"`
- block rewards if `device_type = "test"`

Validation rules using custom event metadata are available in:
- distributions
- loyalty earning rules
- redemption validation

## Automated distributions

You can trigger automatic messages in response to event-related actions.

### Supported distribution triggers

- **Custom event**  
  Sends a message immediately when a specific event is logged.

- **Segment entered**  
  Sends a message when a customer enters an event-based segment.

- **Segment left**  
  Sends a message when a customer no longer meets the segment criteria.

<Tip>
You can refine distributions further by adding validation rules based on customer metadata or custom event metadata.
</Tip>

## Loyalty earning rules with custom events

Custom events can trigger loyalty point assignments.

### Configuring an earning rule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select trigger">
    Create a loyalty campaign and set the earning rule trigger to **custom event**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add validation rules">
    Use the validation rules builder to define qualifying conditions based on event metadata.
    <br />
    <em>Example: award points only if <code>review_type</code> equals <code>video</code>.</em>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and launch">
    Once saved, points are awarded only when incoming event metadata matches the defined criteria.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Internal events reference** 

In addition to custom events, Voucherify tracks over 50 internal customer events out of the box, such as successful redemptions or loyalty point assignments. These events can be used for segmentation, validation rules, and automation without additional development.

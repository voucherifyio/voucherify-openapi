The **Distribution Manager** automates communication with your customers.  
It helps you send promo codes, publish rewards, and deliver updates when specific events happen.

Distributions can send messages directly to customers or push data to external tools such as Braze, Mailchimp, or webhooks.

## Key concepts

Distributions are built from four main elements:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Trigger">
A **trigger** defines *when* Voucherify sends a message.

Examples include:
- a customer enters a segment  
- a voucher is redeemed  
- loyalty points are added  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audience">
The **audience** defines *who* receives the message.

Depending on the trigger, the audience can be:
- a single customer  
- customers in a segment  
- customers affected by an event  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Action">
The **action** defines *what* is sent.

For example:
- a unique code  
- a reward notification  
- a plain message  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Channel">
A **channel** defines *how* the message is delivered.

Common channels include:
- email  
- SMS  
- webhook  
- external integrations like Braze or Mailchimp  
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Distribution types

### Manual distribution

A **manual distribution** is a one-time message sent after you confirm the setup.

- Messages are delivered with a **10-minute delay**
- This delay gives you time to stop or edit the distribution before it is sent

Manual distributions can target:

- a single customer
- a customer segment

### Automatic distribution

An **automatic distribution** sends messages when a trigger event occurs, for example:

- a customer enters a segment
- a voucher is redeemed
- loyalty points are added

Your API version controls the API and webhook behavior you see (e.g., what properties you see in responses, what parameters you’re permitted to send in requests, etc.). Your version is set the first time you make an API request. When we change the API in a backwards-incompatible way, we release a new dated version, but to avoid breaking your code, we don’t change your version until you’re ready to upgrade.

***

## How can I upgrade my API?

If you’re running an older version, you’ll want to upgrade to take advantage of the latest API. For changing your API version, go to your Project Settings and click **Upgrade to the latest API version**.

## Changes which Voucherify considers to be backwards-compatible

* Adding new API resources.
* Adding new optional request parameters to existing API methods.
* Adding new properties to existing API responses.
* Changing the order of properties in existing API responses.
* Changing the length or format of object IDs or other opaque strings.
* Adding new event types. It means that your webhook listener should gracefully handle unfamiliar events types.

## API changelog

| Version                        | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **v2017-04-05 (deprecated)**   | - Responses from the voucher and campaign listing methods were moved to the new object structure. Methods now render specific properties for a total count and an array of objects.<br/>- Introduced validation for listing parameters: `limit` and `page`. A limit can range between 1 and 100 items.<br/>- `Get voucher/campaign` methods render **validation rules** related to the voucher object (can be inherited from a campaign).<br/>- Created an API method for getting a campaign identified by name. |
| **v2017-04-20 (deprecated)**   | Response from the voucher publish method was moved to the new object structure. Returned voucher details are wrapped by a transaction object describing the publication event: `{"id":"pub_whQzIndYoyZoqiLEKN0s04GK","object":"publication","created_at":"2017-04-20T13:18:01Z","customer_id":"cust_mOjhGypfbqch0v3DpAA9LDXj","tracking_id":"janusz","channel":"API","metadata":{"test":true},"voucher":{}}` |
| **v2018-08-01**                | Introduces a new model for building **Validation Rules**. The extended mechanism provides advanced configuration for promo conditions. Changes affect these API methods:<br/><br/>- `List Promotion Tiers`: replaced an object describing conditions by a list of records describing an association between rule and tier (`validation_rule_assignments`).<br/>- `List Promotion Tiers for campaign`: same as above.<br/>- `Promotion Tier Object`: updated to support new structure.<br/>- `Validation Rule Object`: reorganized to handle advanced rules.<br/>- `Validation Rule Assignment Object`: added to describe relation between rules and linked promotions.<br/>- `Validation Rules`: modified data model.<br/><br/>The mechanics and details of the Validation Rules builder are described in the Help Center. |
| **Webhooks v2024-01-01**       | In [v20231205](https://support.voucherify.io/article/23-whats-new-in-voucherify#v20231205), a new version of webhooks was introduced. These webhooks are available for distribution and the events listed in **Project settings**. There, you can switch from the old `v2018-01-01` webhook version to the new one. Accounts created after the `v20231205` release can use **only the new version**. |

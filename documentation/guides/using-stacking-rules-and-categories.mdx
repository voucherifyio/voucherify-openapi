Stacking rules and categories help you control how campaigns behave when more than one campaign is applied in the same order.

This article provides practical examples of what you can achieve with these settings.

## Example 1. Application order changes eligibility

A store runs two campaigns:

- 10% off everything  
- 20% off orders above \$100  

A customer adds products worth \$105.

### Scenario A. 10% applies first

1. 10% discount is applied.  
   \$105 → \$94.50  
2. The order total is now below \$100.  
3. The 20% campaign no longer meets its condition.  

Only the 10% discount applies.

### Scenario B. 20% applies first

1. 20% discount is applied.  
   \$105 → \$84  
2. The 10% discount is then calculated based on your discount calculation settings.  

In this case, the customer receives a larger total discount.

This scenario shows why **incentive application order** and **category hierarchy** matter.

<Note>
Category hierarchy affects the order only when incentive application order is set to use hierarchy in stacking settings.
</Note>

The exact final outcome may also depend on how discounts are calculated (initial vs discounted), configured in stacking settings and category rules.

## Example 2. Partial vs all-or-nothing behavior

A customer applies two campaigns:

- A valid welcome campaign  
- An expired seasonal campaign  

### Scenario A. All

1. The system validates both campaigns.  
2. One campaign fails.  
3. The entire redemption fails.  

The customer receives no discount.

In this mode, even valid campaigns are not applied if any item in the stack fails validation.

### Scenario B. Partial

1. The system validates both campaigns.  
2. The expired campaign fails.  
3. The valid campaign still applies.  

The customer receives the available discount.

This setup prevents a single invalid campaign from blocking checkout.

## Example 3. Exclusive campaign using Never stackable

A store offers:

- 50% VIP campaign  
- 10% newsletter campaign  

The VIP campaign is assigned to a category with:

**Stacking eligibility: Never stackable**

The exclusive campaign blocks Common campaigns in the same redemption. In this case, hierarchy and application order do not matter.

### What happens in the cart?

1. Both campaigns are valid.  
2. The VIP campaign applies.  
3. The newsletter campaign does not apply.  

This is useful for high-value or limited offers.

## Example 4. Combining Never stackable and Always stackable

A store offers:

- A large exclusive discount (Never stackable)  
- A campaign that should always apply if valid  

The second campaign is assigned to:

**Stacking eligibility: Always stackable**

### What happens in the cart?

1. The exclusive campaign is validated and applied.  
2. The Always stackable campaign is also validated.  
3. Both campaigns apply together.  

Always stackable campaigns can join the redemption stack even when an exclusive campaign is used.

This is useful for incentives that should not be blocked by exclusivity.

Whether campaigns can apply together depends on their category stacking eligibility.  
The Compatibility guide shows these combinations in a simple table.

## Example 5. Category stacking limit

A store runs several Flash sale campaigns in one category.

Three campaigns are valid in the cart.

The category stacking limit is set to 2.

Campaigns are applied based on category hierarchy or application order.

### What happens?

1. All three campaigns are validated.  
2. Only two campaigns are applied.  
3. The third campaign is skipped because the category limit is reached.  

The final number of applied campaigns also depends on the global stacking limit.

This scenario helps prevent too many similar discounts from stacking.

Voucherify applies campaigns up to the global maximum, and the category limit can further restrict that number.

## Example 6. Campaign valid but no discount effect

A campaign is valid but produces no effect (for example, the discount value is 0).

### Scenario A. Prevent redemption

1. The campaign is validated.  
2. No discount value is calculated.  
3. The campaign is not redeemed.  

It remains available for later use.

### Scenario B. Force redemption

1. The campaign is validated.  
2. No discount value is calculated.  
3. The campaign is still redeemed.  

It counts as used even without a discount.

## Example 7. Discount calculation mode

Two percentage campaigns are applied together:

- 10% off  
- 20% off  

The order value is \$100.

### Scenario A. Initial calculation

1. 10% of \$100 = \$10  
2. 20% of \$100 = \$20  

Total discount = \$30

### Scenario B. Discounted calculation

1. 10% of \$100 = \$10 → \$90  
2. 20% of \$90 = \$18  

Total discount = \$28

This scenario shows how calculation mode changes the final result.

This behavior depends on the discount calculation mode set in stacking settings or category configuration.

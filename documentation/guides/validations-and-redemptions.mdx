The **Redemptions** section in the **Campaign Hub** is the central hub for monitoring how customers interact with your incentives. It helps you track whether codes are being used successfully or why they are failing.

## Key concepts

To understand how Voucherify tracks activity, it is important to distinguish between these three terms:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Redemptions">
A **redemption** occurs when an incentive is actually applied to an order.

* Voucherify records every attempt, including those that are successful, failed, or reversed.
* You can view details such as the customer involved, the order summary, and the specific campaign.
* **Rollback**: Successful redemptions can be reversed (rolled back) within 3 months of the event if a customer returns an item or an order is cancelled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Validations">
A **validation** is a check to see if a code is eligible for use before the actual redemption happens.

* The **Validations** tab shows which incentives were applicable, inapplicable, or skipped during a check.
* Validation data is stored for 30 days.
* For deeper technical details, such as request and response data, you can review the **Audit Logs**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sessions">
A **validation session** is used to lock a discount for a customer while they are still in the checkout process. This prevents the same code from being used again while a customer is finishing their purchase.

* You can manage and unlock sessions in the **Sessions** tab using the session key.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring and data

### Failed attempts

If a redemption fails, Voucherify provides a failure reason. Common causes include:

* The voucher has expired or is not active.
* Usage or redemption limits have been reached.
* The order or customer does not meet validation rules.

### Detailed logs

Each redemption includes **Detailed Logs**. These logs show technical information such as:

* HTTP method
* Request and response data
* Related events

This view is useful for troubleshooting integrations and validation behavior.

### Exporting data

You can export redemption data as a **CSV file**.

1. Go to the **Redemptions** tab.
2. Apply filters such as status or date range.
3. Click **Export**.
4. Download the file from the **Notification Center** when it is ready.

<Info>
You can also view redemption and validation history for a specific code by opening the **Voucher details** view and checking the **History** tabs.

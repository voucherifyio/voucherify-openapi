Voucherify uses **users**, **projects**, and **roles** to control access to data and actions. This setup helps teams work together while keeping permissions clear and safe.

## Key concepts

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Owner">
The **owner** is not a role. It is a special flag added to a user account.

The owner flag:
- Allows access to **Team Settings**
- Enables management of team-level settings such as users, roles, billing, and security

The owner flag does **not** change role permissions. An owner still follows the limits of the role assigned to them, such as Viewer or User.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Users">
**Users** are people invited to work in the Voucherify dashboard.

After accepting the invitation, users can be assigned to one or more projects. All user actions are logged and visible in audit logs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Projects">
**Projects** group campaigns and data.

User access is managed per project, which means a user may have access to one project but not another.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Roles">
**Roles** define what actions a user can perform, such as viewing data, creating campaigns, or managing settings.

Custom roles are defined at the organization level, while users are assigned roles within projects.
</Accordion>

## Invite a new team member

Only the **account owner** or a user with **Admin** permissions can invite new users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Team Settings">
    Select your username in the bottom-left corner and go to **Team Settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the invitation">
    Open the **Team** tab and choose **Invite member**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide user details">
    Enter the user’s first name, last name, and email address.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign projects and roles">
    Select the projects the user can access. For each project, assign a **role**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the invitation">
    Confirm with **Invite Member**. The user receives an email to activate their account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After activation, the user appears in the team list. You can later update their roles or project access.

## User roles

### Built-in roles

Voucherify includes the following predefined roles:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Admin** | Full access to all data, settings, and user management. |
| **User** | Can create, edit, and export data in assigned projects, but cannot manage users or projects. |
| **Viewer** | Can view and export data but cannot make changes. |
| **Restricted user** | Can work only within assigned areas or stores, set by an Admin or owner. |
| **Merchant** | Has no dashboard access. Can validate and redeem single codes through the API and view own redemptions. |

### Custom roles (Enterprise)

With an Enterprise plan, Admin users can create **custom roles** with specific permissions.

To create a custom role:
1. Go to **Team Settings** > **Roles**.
2. Duplicate an existing role.
3. Enable or disable selected permissions.
4. Save the role.

You can then assign the custom role to users within selected projects.

## Manage user access

You can manage users from **Team Settings** > **Team**.

From the user list, you can:
- Add a user to a project
- Change the user’s role in a project
- Remove the user from a project
- Update user details

Only users with the required permissions can manage roles and assignments.

## Access for partners and affiliates (Merchants)

If partners do not need dashboard access, you can provide **API-only access**.

Merchants:
- Do not access the dashboard
- Can validate and redeem single incentives
- Cannot use stackable redemptions
- Use only the API key assigned to them

To create merchant access:
1. Go to **Project Settings** > **General** > **Application Keys**.
2. Create a new API key.
3. Assign the **Merchant** role.
4. Share the key securely with the partner.

<Info>
**Management API (Enterprise)**  
You can also manage users, roles, and project assignments programmatically using the Management API.

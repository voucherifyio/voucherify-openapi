That article explains the structure, roles, and visibility rules.  
This guide focuses only on configuration.

<Info>
Areas and Stores is an **Enterprise** feature.  
You can create up to **100 areas per project** and **100 stores per area**.

## Assign restricted users

Access configuration happens in two stages:
1. Assign the **User Restricted** role.
2. Define the user's area or store scope.

### Assign the Restricted User role

Only the **Account Owner** can assign or remove this role.

Go to **Team Settings → Team**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select team member">
    Choose the team member.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign role">
    Assign the **User Restricted** role for the project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Define area or store access

Only an **Admin** can define assignments.

Go to **Project Settings → General → Project Members**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit assignments">
    Click **Edit assignments** next to the member with the `USER_RESTRICTED` role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set access list">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Assigning a user to an area does not assign them to that area's stores.  
Use **All stores** if they need access to every store within that area.
</Warning>

A Restricted User can have up to **100 assignments**.

## Create restricted API keys

Admins can create API keys with the **User Restricted** role.  
These keys follow the same visibility rules as a Restricted User.

Go to **Project Settings → General → Application Keys**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create new key">
    Click the **+** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select role">
    Enter a name and select **User Restricted**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define access">
    Click **Edit access list** and select areas, stores, or **All stores**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The **Secret Key** is visible for 15 minutes after generation or regeneration.  
Store it securely.
</Tip>

Restricted Users cannot create or view API keys.  
A Restricted User API key can also have up to **100 assignments**.

## Assign campaigns to areas or stores

Campaign assignment controls where a campaign is visible and usable.

Admins and Users can assign campaigns.  
Restricted Users must assign new campaigns to their own areas or stores.

Open a campaign creation wizard and create a new campaign or edit an existing one. Go to the **Access settings** step.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit access list">
    Click **Edit access list**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select scope">
    Select the areas or stores where the campaign should be available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save campaign">
    Save the campaign.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Global campaigns**

To make a campaign available everywhere:
- Select all areas.
- Within each area, select **All stores**.

If a campaign has no assignment, Restricted Users cannot access it.

If assigned to **All stores**, it automatically applies to stores created later in that area.

A campaign can have up to **100 assignments**.
</Info>

## Manage resources as a Restricted User

Access depends on the role.

- **Admins and Users** can manage all resources in all areas and stores.
- **Restricted Users** can manage resources only within their assigned areas or stores.

### Resources managed within assigned areas or stores

- Campaigns  
- Vouchers  
- Redemptions  
- Validations  
- Publications  
- Qualifications  
- Promotion tiers  
- Combined promotions  

### Resources managed regardless of assignment

- Customers  
- Validation Rules  
- Orders  
- Products  
- Product collections  
- Rewards  
- Locations  
- Categories  
- Distributions  

<Note>
A Restricted User can edit or delete a campaign only if their assignments include **all** of the campaign’s assignments.
</Note>

You can further limit Restricted User permissions by creating a custom role with the **Join areas and stores** permission.

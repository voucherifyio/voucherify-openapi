## What is GDPR?

The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR), a European privacy law approved by the European Commission, is an attempt to strengthen, modernize EU data protection law, and enhance individual rights and freedoms, consistent with the European understanding of privacy as a fundamental human right. The GDPR regulates, among other things, how individuals and organizations may obtain, use, store, and remove personal data. In a nutshell, it's giving EU citizens and residents control over their data while simplifying the regulatory environment for international businesses that operate in the EU.

The authors of this regulation introduce the concept of **data minimization** which forces companies to:
* Collect as little information as they need to run the business.
* Inform customers about every way their data will be processed (including 3rd party providers).
* Enable customers to delete, export, or update their data at any point in time.

## Voucherify commitment to data privacy and GDPR compliance

**Voucherify is a GDPR-compliant data processor**. To find the comprehensive security and data protection measures we have implemented, visit our [legal section](http://www.voucherify.io/legal). Take a look at an overview of what we have done to meet the regulation requirements:

* **Data Processing Addendum** – we offer a data processing addendum (DPA) for our customers who collect data from folks in the EU. Our DPA offers contractual terms that meet GDPR requirements and that reflect our data privacy and security commitments to our customers.
* **GDPR-ready contracts with third-party vendors** – Voucherify uses only trusted and reliable vendors. we have signed data processing agreements with all partners which subprocess any of your sensitive data. This approach makes our platform fully GDPR compliant, so you can be confident that your data are neither stored nor processed in a non-secure environment.
* **Employee training** – Data Protection Officer ensures that all employees receive tools and training for handling sensitive data (including credentials) and for avoiding social engineering and other non-technical attacks. Moreover, Voucherify team access is controlled by a carefully managed and audited security policy.
* **Updates to our Terms and Privacy** – we’ve introduced updates to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to ensure we are fully compliant with the GDPR. We openly describe what personal data we are collecting, processing, why, how we use it, who we share it with, and how long we store it.
* **Risk Assessment** – Data Protection Impact Assessment process guarantees that the Voucherify team considers data protection risk identification and minimization as its priority. Every change to the software, organizational procedures, or tooling triggers privacy due diligence. If any risk is identified, the team collaborates on a solution to mitigate the consequences for our clients and their end-customers.
* **Data Access, Portability, and Deletion** – new features have been introduced to stay in line with data regulations for the right of portability, to be forgotten, and to rectification, see the section below for details and tutorials.

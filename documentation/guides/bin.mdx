In Voucherify, there are two ways to remove resources: move them to the bin or delete them permanently. When a resource is moved to the bin, you cannot create a new one with the same unique identifiers (for example, the same source ID or code name). Thanks to the bin feature, you can permanently delete the resources moved to the bin.

<Warning>
Items moved to the bin cannot be restored.
</Warning>

<Tip>
If you need help permanently removing any previously soft-deleted items that are not appearing in your bin, please contact the Voucherify support team.

## Supported resources

The resources that can be moved to the bin are:

- campaigns
- products
- SKUs
- vouchers

## Access to the bin

The bin can be accessed through the left-side panel. It is situated right below the audit log.

The bin is visible to and can be managed by users who have all of the following permissions:

- read vouchers
- read campaigns
- read products

## Filters

The bin has the following filtering options to make finding specific items easier:

- resource ID
- resource type
- resource name

The maximum number of items displayed per page is 25.

## Delete a resource

Click the three-dot menu at the end of the line of an item to display the delete permanently button.

To permanently delete a resource, the user must have the following permissions:

- delete vouchers
- delete campaigns
- create and modify products and products collections

Before permanently deleting an item, a popup window will appear. It informs that this action is irreversible and that new objects with the same source ID, name, or code can now be created.

<Note>
Campaign deletion is an asynchronous process. Depending on the number of vouchers in the campaign, it might take a significant amount of time.

Product collections group products based on shared attributes or specific criteria. These collections are essential for modeling product-specific validation rules, such as limiting a promotion to a specific category or defining loyalty earning rules for certain items.

## Collection types

Voucherify offers two types of collections to manage your inventory effectively:

* **Static collection**: A fixed group of up to 20 products that remains unchanged after saving.
* **Dynamic collection**: A flexible group that automatically updates in real-time based on filter criteria.

<Info>
You can create up to 100 product collections in each project.
</Info>

## Create a static collection

Static collections are ideal for fixed sets of items, such as a "Holiday bundle." 

<Note>
Adding a product to a static collection automatically includes all its associated SKUs.
</Note>

To create a collection head to the Campaigh Hub > Product Collections and press the '+ Create collection' button in the top right corner.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Name">
    Provide a name for your collection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark items">
    Mark the checkboxes next to the products you want to include in the collection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalize">
    Click **Save as collection** and select **Static collection**.
  </Step>

</Steps>

<Warning>
Once saved, a static collection cannot be edited or updated with new products.
</Warning>

## Create a dynamic collection

Dynamic collections automatically manage products using filters, adding or removing items in real time as they meet or no longer meet the defined criteria.

To create a collection head to the Campaigh Hub > Product Collections and press the '+ Create collection' button in the top right corner.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Name">
    Provide a name for your collection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define filter criteria">
    Apply filters (such as price, category, or metadata) to define your collection criteria.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalize">
    Click **Save as collection** and choose **Dynamic collection**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### SKUs and dynamic collections

In dynamic collections, validation is performed separately for products and SKUs. 

<Tip>
A SKU does not automatically enter a dynamic collection just because its parent product matches the filters. Each SKU must individually meet the filter criteria to be included.
</Tip>

## Predefined collections

Every Voucherify project includes a predefined collection called **All Products**.

* **Content**: This collection automatically gathers every item added to your account and items sent within API requests.
* **Use case**: Use this to build validation rules that must be checked against every item in a customer's order.

## Collection maintenance

You can manage your collections through the **Product Collections** tab in the dashboard and via the [API](/api-reference/product-collections/product-collection-object).

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="View and audit collections">
    You can view the full list of collections, inspect the products currently included, and review the filters used to create dynamic criteria.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deleting collections">
    If a collection is no longer needed, you can delete it from the dashboard. 
    <Warning>
      Deleting a collection may impact active campaigns or validation rules that rely on it.

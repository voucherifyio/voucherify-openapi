title: New Voucherify documentation
description: Key changes to the documentation experience ðŸš€
tag: NEW
---

We've updated Voucherify's documentation platform to give you a better experience of exploring docs. Documentation still includes **Guides**, **API reference**, and **Changelog**, but there's a couple of big changes!

## Exploring content

- **Searchbar**: Searchbar is now moved to the top of the page.
- **Copy page**: Ask questions about the page content with ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity. You can also view and copy pages in the Markdown format for LLMs.
- **RSS**: Subscribe to RSS in the [Changelog](/changelog/changelog) and follow latest Voucherify updates.
- **Webhook documentation**: Improved documentation of webhooks and Voucherify events. The content is shown in a clearer way.

<Warning>
URLs of pages in **Guides** and **API reference** have changed. We've set redirects for you, so your bookmarks still work, but some pages may return 404. Use searchbar to quickly find what you need!
</Warning>

## New interactive API playground

The API playground (Try it feature) works similarly as before. It allows you to test API endpoints directly from the documentation:

- **Live testing**: Execute API calls without leaving the docs.
- **Pre-filled authentication**: When logged in, your API keys from the Sandbox project are automatically populated in the playground.
- **Real responses**: See actual API responses in real-time.

<Note>
The API playground uses Sandbox project data. Your requests won't affect your production environment and data stored there.
</Note>

### How to use the playground

1. Go to any endpoint in the API Reference section.
2. Click the **Log in** button in the top right corner to authenticate.
3. Once logged in, your API credentials will be automatically filled in the playground.
4. Click Try it to open a pop-up window to adjust request parameters as needed. You can also use predefined examples.
5. Click "Send" to execute the request and view the response.

The login feature ensures your API keys are securely pre-filled, so you don't have to copy and paste credentials for each request.

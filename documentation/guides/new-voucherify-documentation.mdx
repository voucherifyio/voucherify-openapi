description: Key changes to the documentation experience
---

We've updated our documentation platform to provide you with a better experience. Here's what's changed:

## Enhanced navigation

- **Improved search** - Find what you need faster with enhanced search capabilities
- **Better organization** - Clearer structure with tabs for Guides, API Reference, and Changelog
- **Responsive design** - Optimized experience across all devices

## Interactive API playground

The API playground (Try it feature) allows you to test API endpoints directly from the documentation:

- **Live testing** - Execute API calls without leaving the docs
- **Pre-filled authentication** - When logged in, your API keys are automatically populated in the playground
- **Real responses** - See actual API responses in real-time

### How to use the playground

1. Navigate to any endpoint in the API Reference section
2. Click the "Log in" button in the top right corner to authenticate
3. Once logged in, your API credentials will be automatically filled in the playground
4. Adjust request parameters as needed
5. Click "Send" to execute the request and view the response

The login feature ensures your API keys are securely pre-filled, eliminating the need to copy and paste credentials for each request.

## Improved code examples

- **Multiple languages** - Code examples available in various programming languages
- **Copy functionality** - One-click copy for all code snippets
- **Syntax highlighting** - Enhanced readability with better code formatting

## Better content discovery

- **Related pages** - Easily find connected documentation
- **Breadcrumb navigation** - Always know where you are in the docs
- **Table of contents** - Quick navigation within each page

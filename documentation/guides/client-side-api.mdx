title: "Client-side API"
---

Sometimes it's important to validate a promo code or promotion on the client side, e.g., you want to calculate and display a discounted price on the fly. That's why Voucherify comes with client-side features built into [Voucherify JS SDK](https://github.com/voucherifyio/voucherify-js-sdk) - an open-source JavaScript library that enables you to query the API.

Among other features, it delivers [Voucherify React Widgets](https://github.com/voucherifyio/voucherify-js-sdk#-voucherify-react-widget)

Voucherify JS SDK offers many client-side features:

* `validate widget` which enables your customers to validate their codes and check its validity in a given context.
* `redeem widget` which enables your customers to redeem the promo codes.
* `publish widget` which enables your customers to a unique voucher from a given campaign in exchange for providing an email address.
* `subscribe widget` which adds a [customer](/api-reference/customers/get-customer) to Voucherify. You can then use one of the automatic delivery channels to send him/her a coupon. [Read more here](https://voucherifyio.github.io/voucherify-js-sdk/#client-side-methods).

## API requests rate limit

To keep your vouchers and promotions safe from fraudulent customer behavior, Voucherify limits the rate of public client requests coming from a single IP address. The current limit can be found at [Limits](/guides/limits) section.

When the limit is exceeded, Voucherify returns:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Response
  {
      "code": 429,
      "message": "Too many requests hit the API too quickly."
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Installation & reference

Visit [Github repository](https://github.com/voucherifyio/voucherify-js-sdk) to get the current documentation.

## Client-side Settings

Use Client-side Settings in the general tab of the Project Settings to configure which actions can be performed directly from your website or client application using the Voucherify API.

### Website URL

Enter your website or app domain to allow Voucherify’s client-side SDK or API to make requests.
Use * to allow requests from any domain (not recommended for production).

**Danger Zone**

<Warning>
These settings control which Voucherify API endpoints can be accessed directly from a client app (browser or mobile).
Client-side access is limited and should be enabled only if necessary.
</Warning>

### Enable client-side redemption

Allows redemptions to be made directly from a client app using the Client-side API.
<Warning>This is insecure because users may change request data. Use server-side redemption whenever possible.</Warning>

### Enable client-side publication

Allows publishing vouchers via client-side SDK or API.

### Enable client-side vouchers listing

Enables fetching available vouchers directly from the client (e.g., to display user-specific rewards).

### Enable client-side customer creation

Lets the client create customer profiles via the Client-side API.
Use carefully — this can expose customer metadata creation to the browser.

### Enable client-side voucher expiration date update

Allows updating voucher expiration dates from the client.
Rarely needed; use only for controlled test cases.

### Enable client-side loyalty and referral programs events

Allows the client to send loyalty and referral events (e.g., “purchase made”, “friend invited”) directly from a user device.

## Get your API keys

To use the Voucherify API, you need two credentials:
- **Application ID** (sent as `X-App-Id` header)
- **Application secret key** (sent as `X-App-Token` header)

Add these headers to every API request.

**To find your keys:**

1. Go to **Project settings**.
2. Open the **General** tab.
3. Scroll to the **Application keys** section.

**Key types:**

- **Application keys** – Use these to authorize API requests from your server. You can create multiple keys for different users.
- **Client-side keys** – Use these for public applications like mobile apps and websites.
- **Integration keys** – Use these to connect with other platforms.

<Warning>
  **Sandbox API keys are always visible.**

  In production projects:
  - Primary secret key: visible for 14 days after first generation, or 15 minutes after regeneration
  - Secondary secret keys: visible for 15 minutes after generation or regeneration

  Save your secret keys immediately and store them securely.
</Warning>

## Making your first API call

Your Sandbox project comes with several test campaigns and codes.

One of the most frequent API calls is validation, which checks if incentives, such as codes, can be applied by the customer to their order.

Make your first validation call:

1. Log in with your Voucherify account details in the top right corner here in this page. Your Sandbox API keys will be used as credentials in the interactive documentation to make API calls.

2. Go to [Validate stackable discounts](/api-reference/validations/validate-stackable-discounts).

3. In Base URL, select your region depending on the region you've chosen when creating a new account:

   * `api` for Europe
   * `us1.api` for North America
   * `as1.api` for Asia

4. Unroll EXAMPLES and select Sandbox onboarding validation.

5. Click `Try it!` to send the request.

Check the response in the window below the request.

You can use the interactive documentation on the left to add more details to the request.

Alternatively, you can use Voucherify [Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/voucherify) to make your first API call.

As the next step, take a look at the [Sandbox project and the Demo shop](#exploring-the-voucherify-api-in-the-sandbox-project) to test your first campaigns. In the Demo shop, use the test campaigns with pre-defined validation rules to learn Voucherify possibilities or create your campaigns and experiment with the platform. You can also check the payloads of the API calls.

## Voucherify API Postman collection

Start exploring the Voucherify API with minimum effort.

You can view all of the Voucherify API endpoints with the public collection available in [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), which is an app you can use to test and work with APIs. Check out the examples of the basic processes required to integrate Voucherify with your system, advanced interactions, and industry-specific cases.

1. Go to [Voucherify Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/overview).
2. Fork the collection to create a copy in your own Postman workspace. For onboarding, fork [Voucherify API – Onboarding](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/iut4une/voucherify-api-onboarding).
3. Provide the required credentials in the Environments.
4. Make your first [validation request](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/request/m646u4g/onboarding-validation-request)!

The Voucherify public workspace in Postman work includes:

* [Core API endpoints](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/z8gcn5w/voucherify-api-core-api-endpoints): Lists all Voucherify endpoints.
* [Integration examples](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/ymwnigh/voucherify-api-integration-examples): Shows examples of integrations and business scenarios.
* [Sandbox onboarding](https://www.postman.com/voucherify/voucherify-s-public-workspace/collection/iut4une/voucherify-api-onboarding): Contains API requests that help you with learning about Voucherify.

## Exploring the Voucherify API in the Sandbox project

You can learn more about Voucherify API also through the dashboard in the [Sandbox project](https://support.voucherify.io/article/538-sandbox) even if you explore the Voucherify API by sending requests and analyzing responses through the interactive API reference or the Postman collection.

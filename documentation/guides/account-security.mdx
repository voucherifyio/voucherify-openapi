---

Voucherify provides tools that help protect your account and monitor important activity. Some settings apply only to your user account, while others can be enforced for the whole team.

You can manage security settings in two places:
- **My profile > Security** for personal settings
- **Team settings > Security** for account-level rules (admin only)

## Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra step to the login process. In addition to your password, you must confirm your identity using a second method.

### Enforce two-factor authentication for the team

Only the **account owner** can enforce two-factor authentication for all users.

To enable enforcement:
1. Go to **Team settings** and open the **Security** tab
2. Turn on **Enforce two-factor authentication**
3. Choose a start date or select **Now**
4. Save the changes

After enforcement, each user must set up two-factor authentication during their next login.

### Set up two-factor authentication for your account

Each user configures two-factor authentication in **My profile > Security**.

Voucherify supports the following methods:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Google Authenticator">
Use the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device. Scan the QR code or enter the code manually. The app generates a verification code for each login.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SMS codes">
Provide your phone number to receive a one-time verification code by text message each time you log in.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Backup codes">
Voucherify generates ten one-time backup codes. Store them in a safe place and use them only if you cannot access your phone.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Backup codes alone are less secure. Voucherify recommends using Google Authenticator or SMS as your main method.
</Info>

## Password management

You can change your password at any time.

To update your password:
1. Go to **My profile** > **Security**
2. Choose **Change password**
3. Enter your current password and a new password
4. Save the change

You receive an email notification every time your password is changed.

## Single sign-on with SAML

SAML single sign-on (SSO) allows users to log in using a company identity provider instead of a Voucherify password.

Voucherify supports providers such as Azure, Auth0, OneLogin, Okta, and PingIdentity.

### How SAML login works

- Users must already exist in Voucherify
- The email address must match the email used in the identity provider
- Users log in from the identity provider dashboard or a SAML login page

If SAML is enforced, users cannot log in using email and password.

### Enable SAML authentication

To enable SAML:
1. Create a SAML application in your identity provider
2. Copy the **Identity provider entry point URL** and the certificate
3. Go to **Team settings** > **Security**
4. Enable SAML and paste the required values
5. Save the configuration

Voucherify generates a **Callback URL**. Add this URL to your identity provider configuration.

<Warning>
Always test SAML login before enforcing it. Enforcing SAML without testing may block user access.
</Warning>

### Advanced SAML options

For advanced security setups, you can:
- sign SAML requests
- encrypt or decrypt SAML responses

These options are available for specific integration needs.

## Activity logs

Logs help you review account and project activity.

### Account activity logs

Account activity logs are available in **My profile > Security**.

They include:
- login events
- password changes
- updates to security settings

### Project audit logs

Project-level activity is available in the **Audit log** section of the dashboard.

Audit logs show:
- API requests and responses
- request source
- related objects such as campaigns or orders

These logs help track technical activity and data changes.

## Monitoring and alerts

Voucherify provides alerts that help you monitor account usage and important events. Alerts do not block access, but they help you react quickly when attention is needed.

You can manage alerts in the **Notification center**.

### User notifications

User notifications relate to project activity and background processes. These settings apply only to the logged-in user.

You can manage them in:
**Notifications (sidebar)** → **Go to Notification center** → **User settings**

Examples include:
- campaign updates
- voucher generation results
- imports and exports
- background tasks

Each notification has predefined delivery channels:
- some are in-app only
- some support email
- some support both

You can turn delivery channels on or off using **Show details**.

### Account-level notifications

Account-level notifications relate to system limits and technical delivery. These settings apply to the whole account and are managed by admins.

You can manage them in:
**Notifications (sidebar)** → **Go to Notification center** → **Account settings**

Examples include:
- API usage thresholds
- message limits
- failed webhook callouts

These notifications usually support in-app and email delivery. Some require at least one email address to be set.

<Info>
Account-level notifications are informational. They do not block API calls or user access.

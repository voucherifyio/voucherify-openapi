<Info>
We are moving the [Voucherify support docs](https://support.voucherify.io/) here. Now you'll find the User Dashboard guides, Developer guides, and API reference all in one spot.
</Info>

## Why the change?

We want to make your life easier. You shouldn't have to jump between different websites to find answers.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Everything in one place" icon="house">
    No more switching tabs. Search for dashboard how-tos and API code in the same search bar.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ask the AI" icon="sparkles">
    Use our AI assistant to get instant answers about the dashboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Easier to read" icon="book-open">
    Strict and to the point, as we're rewriting guides to be clearer and cutting out the fluff.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Up to date" icon="rotate">
    No more outdated images! We're refreshing our content to match the latest features. 
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What happens now?

This won't happen overnight, but here is what you can expect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Right now">
    You can use this site *and* the [old support site](https://support.voucherify.io/). Both still work.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Moving forward">
    We are focusing on this site. We will slowly stop updating the old one.
    
    <Note>
    If an article on the old site is outdated, we'll put a clear label on it so you know.
    </Note>

    <Warning>
    We're still working on the new documentation here. You may notice that some sections or articles changed titles or similar changes to content have happened.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="The goal">
    Eventually, the old site will redirect here, and this will be the only place you need to go.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Need help?

If you can't find something, the old site is still there for now.

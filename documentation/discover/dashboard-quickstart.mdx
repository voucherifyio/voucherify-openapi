Start your journey with Voucherify, an incentive optimization engine, and prepare your account for the first campaign. In this tutorial, you'll learn key concepts of Voucherify that will let you build attractive and effective promo campaigns.

A Voucherify account gives you access to API and Dashboard. This means that marketing teams and developers can create and manage Voucherify promotions.

<Note>

If you're a developer, go to [Developer hub](/guides/introduction) to learn more about Voucherify API and other technicalities.

You can also find there details about [planning your integration](/guides/integration-overview).

</Note>

<CreateAcc/>

Voucherify gives you a 60 day trial to play and test the platform for free in a Sandbox project. A project is an environment within a single account to create your incentive campaigns. You can have specific production and testing environments or create separate projects for different markets or time zones.

If you upgrade from trial to a paid plan, Sandbox will be visible in your projects list, but it won't be counted toward your project limit.

## Onboarding

Once logged in, Voucherify will lead you through a marketer onboarding tour. As part of the tour, you can create your first campaign and set up additional rules to fine tune your promotion activity.

If you don't want to follow the onboarding tour, you can skip it any time. 

Alternatively, you can create your first campaign with the tutorial below.

## Tutorial: Set up a generic code campaign

Here, you'll create a discount coupon campaign that uses a validation rule to show how Voucherify's rule engine works in practice.

Go to Voucherify and follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the campaign builder">
    In the left sidebar, navigate to **Campaign hub** > **Campaigns** > **Create campaign**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select campaign type">
    Select **Discount coupons** out of the available campaign types.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set campaign details">
    Configure the basic details:
    1. Name your campaign, for example *FLASH campaign*.
    2. Select **Generic (standalone) code** and type your code name, for example *FLASH!*.
    3. Leave **Redemption limit** set to **Unlimited**; this means that the code can be used any number of times, by any number of customers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Time frame (skip)">
    Go to **Time frame**, but leave the settings as they are. You don't need to set up when the campaign starts, expires, or when it's active or inactive for this tutorial.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set basic discount details">
    Configure the basic discount details:
    1. Go to **Discount value**, click **Add discount** > **Order discount**.
    2. In **Discount type**, leave **Amount discount: Apply to whole cart** and set **Discount amount** to `10`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set conditions and validation rule">
    
    Go to **Conditions** and click the plus button to open the validation rule builder. Here, you'll set conditions that will limit who can use the code and what the cart will need to include for the coupon to be applicable.
    
    Click **Add rule**, add name (for example *FLASH campaign validation rule*), and configure the following rules:
    1. In **Products**, set **Any order item** to **Collection** > **All coffees**. This means that the cart will have to include a coffee product.
    2. In **Prices and quantities**, set **Total amount** to **is more than 99.99**. This means that a customer's cart total amount will have to be 100 or more.
    3. In **Budget constraints**, set **Redemptions per customer in a campaign** to **is less than or equal to 1**. This means that a customer can only use the *FLASH!* coupon once.
    4. Click **Save**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save discount">
    In the discount builder, click **Save** again.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Metadata (skip)">
    You can set voucher or campaign custom attributes. Skip this step in this tutorial and go to the next step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check summary">
    You can check the campaign configuration if everything's configured correctly.
    
    Click **Save** to create campaign.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### FLASH campaign in the Demo shop

Each project has a **Demo shop**. It shows how the integration between Voucherify and customer touchpoints works in practice.

Once you've created the *FLASH campaign*, check it out in the **Demo shop** to see the rule engine works in action. 

In this tutorial, you'll check scenarios when validation fails and succeeds depending on different validation rule conditions.

You've set the *FLASH!* coupon to have the following conditions:
1. A coffee product in the cart (beans, not coffee machines).
2. Cart whose total amount is 100 or more.
3. The coupon can be redeemed only once by a given customer.

In the upper side of the **Demo shop**, click the entry button to select a customer. You can select, for example, Karen Doe.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Validation fail: wrong product in the cart">

    First, check how the coupon validation fails, because the first condition of the validation rule is not met:
    1. Add **Roast Master - coffee machine** to the cart.
    2. Go to **Cart**. The cart meets the 2. condition, as it's above 100.
    3. Find the *FLASH!* coupon in **Promotions** and click **Apply**.

    You will see an error message at the bottom of the screen that the coupon can't be applied, because the cart doesn't have coffee beans, which would meet the first condition.

    </Step>
    
    <Step title="Validation fail: wrong total amount">
    Now, check how the coupon validation fails, because the second condition of the validation rule is not met:
    1. Remove **Roast Master - coffee machine** from the cart.
    2. Go back to **Shop** and add **Sumatra - Burbon** (SKU: 1000g) to the cart to meet the 1. condition. Add only one unit.
    3. Find the *FLASH!* coupon in **Promotions** and click **Apply**.

    You will see an error message at the bottom of the screen that the coupon can't be applied, because the cart total amount doesn't exceed 100, which would meet the second condition.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Validation success">

    Now, validate and redeem (use) the coupon successfully:
    1. Add a second unit of **Sumatra - Burbon** to the cart. The cart total amount should now exceed 100.
    2. Find the *FLASH!* coupon in **Promotions** and click **Apply**.

    You'll receive a success message that the coupon has been applied. The discount is applied to the cart and the total amount has changed.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Validation fail: customer used their coupon">
    
    Now, check how the coupon validation fails, because the third condition of the validation rule is not met:
    1. In the cart above, click **Go to payment** > **Submit order and redemption** to finalize the purchase.
    2. Once done, the content of the cart will remain the same. Find the *FLASH!* coupon in **Promotions** and click **Apply**.

    You will see an error message at the bottom of the screen that the coupon can't be applied, because the same customer, Karen Doe, tries to use the coupon for the second time. This doesn't meet the third condition, even though the first two conditions are met.

    If you change the customer to Jane Doe, the coupon can be used again, because the overall redemption limit for the whole campaign is unlimited.

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Check default Sandbox data

As Sandbox comes with sample products, customers, validation rules, and campaigns, it's good to check them out. This way you can quickly learn more about different promotions and Voucherify's other possibilities.

Check out the following places:
- In **Campaign hub**:
  - **Campaigns**: Lists all created campaigns; by default, Sandbox includes all campaign types.
  - **Validation rules**: Lists all created validation rules.
  - **Products**: Lists all created products.
  - **Product collections**: Lists all collections, which group the products that share defined criteria.
- In **Engagement**:
  - **Customers**: Lists all added customers. Be default, you'll have three customers.
  - **Segments**: Lists all segments, which group the customers who share defined criteria.

<Tip>

In **Campaigns**, click through the listed campaigns to learn how they're configured. You can also edit them to check their settings within the campaign builder and try to recreate them in other campaigns. Also, it's good to clone a campaign and to tweak their settings in a safe way in their duplicate.

Similarly, you can check and clone validation rules to get a better understanding of how the rule engine can be configured.

</Tip>

## Play around in the Demo shop

If you haven't created and checked the [FLASH campaign](#flash-campaign-in-the-demo-shop), Use **Demo shop** to try out campaigns and check how they work for test customers.

In the Demo shop, you can select a customer to:
- Apply incentives: Use the **Promotions** section to apply incentives.
- Add products to cart: Browse products from the product list and click **Add to Cart**.
- Manage **Cart**: Review your cart.
- Access **Customer wallet**: View coupons, loyalty cards, gift cards, and all the other available incentives in the Wallet Panel.

You can validate and redeem codes from created campaigns to test different scenarios and validation rules for different customers. The results of each redemption are logged in the **Redemptions** section of the dashboard.

### What scenarios can I test with the Demo shop?

You can check the following:
- Choosing a customer to check incentives for customer segments
- Qualification for incentives
- Discount vouchers validation and redemption
- Promotion validation and redemption
- Pay with loyalty points: loyalty card validation and redemption
- Pay with gift card: gift cards validation and redemption, choose how much gift card credits to apply to an order
- Stacking multiple incentives
- Region- and currency-specific campaigns

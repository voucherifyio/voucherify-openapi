## How the sections connect

Each section builds on the previous one:

1. **Prepare**: Import customers, products, and define metadata. This data powers your validation rules and segments.
2. **Build**: Choose a campaign type and configure the incentive mechanics.
3. **Optimize**: Add validation rules to control who can redeem, set time windows, and create rewards.

<Tip>

Start with the Prepare section to set up your foundational data. Well-structured customer and product data makes campaign targeting faster and more accurate.
